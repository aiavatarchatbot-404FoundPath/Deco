Sexting.pdf,0,"Sexting What is ‘sexting’? Sexting is creating, sending, possessing or posting sexual messages, photos or videos on phones or over the internet. Is sexting illegal? If the images are of people under 16 years and are sexual they may be classed as “child exploitation material” (commonly referred to as child pornography). It is illegal to make, distribute or possess child exploitation material.1 Child exploitation material is text, images or sound showing a person under 16 in a sexual way that is likely to offend an adult.2 It includes images of: • the person’s breasts, bottom, penis or vagina; or • the person doing something sexual or near someone doing something sexual (such as having sex). Even if the image only shows part of the person, it can still be child pornography - for example, it doesn’t show the faces of the people having sex, or if it is only a part of the body, for example exposed breasts. It doesn’t matter if the images are of you, or someone else who was ok with the image being made: if the image is of someone under 16 years then it is child pornography. It is illegal to do, or try to do, the following with child exploitation material images: • make them • have them (possession) • give them to someone, agree to give to someone by phone or email or post. It is also illegal to: • make someone under 16 years see indecent films, pictures, photos, and written material without a proper reason (for example, it’s ok for a sex education class) • use the internet or phone to get someone under 16 to do a sexual act.3 If you are 16 or 17 you could also be charged for doing similar things under Commonwealth Law. 1 Criminal Code"

The person does not need to be afraid or suffer harm, the material just has to be of the type that would usually cause a person to be afraid or suffer harm (See the ‘Treated Unfairly & discrimination’ Fact sheet for further information about Stalking).4 If we are both under 16 is it still against the law? If you have taken a sexual photo / video of yourself and sent it to someone else then you could be charged with three separate charges of: • possessing (having) • making • sending • child exploitation material.5 If you are found guilty of these types of offences, you can be placed on the Sex Offenders Register.

If you share or threaten to share a photo/video of someone else who is under 16 years, which shows them doing something sexual or shows their genital or anal area (even if they are wearing underwear) or their breasts (even if the person in the photo/video agrees to you sharing it) you can be charged with the criminal offence of distributing intimate images.6 This applies even if you are under the age of 16. If the person in the photo/video is over 16 it is an offence to threaten to share it or share it without their consent.7 What if someone sends me a photo or video which might be child pornography?

If you have been convicted and a conviction has been recorded for of an offence involving any sexual activity with someone under 16, including sexting more than one time, you can be put on the Child Protection Offender Reporting Register.1 This means you have to report details about yourself and where you are to police. This is so police can keep track of where you are living and working. If you have not been found guilty of a sexual offence against a person under 16, but you have been convicted of another offence and the court thinks you are a sexual risk to anyone under 16 it can order you to report details about yourself and your movements.2 You must be given a written document by a Youth Justice Officer or Police Officer which says what things you have to report to police about. If you think the court should not have made this order speak to your lawyer about an appeal. If you have to report, your details will be put on the Child Protection Offender Reporting Register.3 Only certain people can see this register and they have to keep the information confidential.4 You may also be recorded on a national sex offenders register. Once someone’s name is on the Queensland register it can only be removed if the police agree.

The length of time you have to report for depends on the specific offences you have been found guilty of and whether you were later found guilty of further sexual offences against people under 16 years of age.15 Where and how do I report? If you are given a Notice that says you have to report at a particular police station then you need to report at that station in person, otherwise you can report to your local police station in person.16 You should take ID to show who you are or the police officer may take your fingerprints. You must provide a DNA sample to the police if they ask for it.17 8 Child Protection (Offender Reporting and Offender Prohibition Order) Act 2004 (Qld), s14 & schedule 3. 9 Ibid. 10 Ibid. 11 Child Protection (Offender Reporting and Offender Prohibition Order) Act 2004 (Qld) s 20. 12 Child Protection (Offender Reporting and Offender Prohibition Order) Act 2004 (Qld) s 22. 13 Child Protection (Offender Reporting and Offender Prohibition Order) Act 2004 (Qld) s 24. 14 Child Protection (Offender Reporting and Offender Prohibition Order) Act 2004 (Qld) s 22. 15 Child Protection (Offender Reporting and Offender Prohibition Order) Act 2004 (Qld) s 36. 16 17 Child protection"

When you report in person you can ask to speak to the police where other people cannot hear and you can have someone with you to support you. As soon as possible after the police receive your report, the police officer must send you a letter with a copy of the information you reported. What if I move to a different state? The law says you have to tell the police in Queensland if you plan to move out of Queensland.19 The law in your new state might also say you have to report to the police once you get there.

Police-Facts-You-Need-to-Know-November-2023.pdf,0,"POLICE – FACTS YOU NEED TO KNOW This sheet is intended to provide general legal information about the law in Queensland. This information is not legal advice. If you have a particular legal problem you should contact a solicitor for legal advice. At the end is a list of agencies that might be able to assist you, including legal agencies. What do I have to tell the police? You have the right to silence. This applies even if you have been arrested for questioning. This means that do not have to make a statement or answer any questions, except you must give your correct name, address, and age. Not giving your name, address or age is an offence. Remember, there is no such thing as an ‘off-the-record chat.’ If you choose to answer police questions you can choose to answer only some of the questions and not all. It is a good idea to get legal advice before answering police questions. You can get free legal advice from the lawyers listed below. Anything you say can be used (and often is) in a police case against you. Do I have to carry ID on me? No… There is no law that says you have to carry ID, BUT if a police officer believes you have given a false name, address or age, they can detain you to find out who you are. If you are driving a car (including on a ‘L’ or ‘P’ plate) then it is an offence to fail to produce your driver’s licence if the police request it. Do Police have to show their ID? Sometimes… If a police officer is in plain clothes and they want to do something like arrest, search or make you ‘move-on’ the officer must tell you that they are a"

Sometimes… If a police officer is in plain clothes and they want to do something like arrest, search or make you ‘move-on’ the officer must tell you that they are a police officer and state their name, rank and station and show you their ID. If they are in uniform, they just have to tell you their name, rank and station. If the officer does not tell you, you can ASK. Do I have to go with a police officer? You do not have to go with a police officer unless you are arrested, but there is a law which states you must go with them if you have witnessed a breach of the peace. The police can arrest you to question you if they believe that you have broken or are breaking the law. If you are arrested for questioning you still do not have to answer any questions except to give your correct name, address and age. Unless the police know a lawyer has been organised for you, the police must contact a representative from a legal aid organisation and inform them before you are questioned. When can the police take my photograph? The police can only photograph you if you are arrested and charged. You do not have to agree to be photographed when being ‘street checked”. All police have body-worn cameras and there are rules police have to follow about how they use these cameras. All police must wear a body-worn camera while they are on-duty, and they can record you.

What rules do the police have to follow when using a body-worn camera? • The police cannot record unclothed searches, but can record clothed searches • The police do not have to stop recording you if you ask • The police generally have to be in uniform, or easily identifiable as a police officer, when using a body-worm camera • Whatever the police record can be used as evidence. If police have Body Worn Cameras they must record if they - • Are investigating a crime (e.g. seizing property or searching you) or arresting someone • Are using physical force against a person • Believe something should be recorded (the police can also start recording after an incident occurs). Do I have to be in a line up or give a DNA sample? No… You do not have to go with a police officer to be in a line up or to give them your DNA even if the police say they think you have broken the law. You should talk to a lawyer before agreeing to either of these things. © Youth Advocacy Centre Inc 1 Can police move me on? Yes, if … • You are in a public place or regulated place; and • Police think you caused (either through your behaviour or by just being there) a certain effect on people like causing anxiety.

You can ask why you are under arrest, but resisting arrest is an offence. You have the right to ask why the police officer is demanding you go with them. If you are not under arrest, then you do not have to go with the police. If you are under arrest, a police officer must tell you why you are under arrest. Even if you have been arrested and charged you do not have to answer police questions. The police usually will not tell you about your right to remain silent unless they have decided to charge you with a criminal offence. A police officer is only allowed to use ‘reasonable force’ to carry out their job. Stay cool and calm and talk to a lawyer later about what you can do if you think the arrest was unfair or wrong or the police injured you. How long can the police hold me? The police can arrest and hold you for questioning for up to 8 hours to investigate an offence and question you about any offences they think you may have committed. They can only question you for 4 hours of that time. The time limit starts at the time you were arrested or were taken by police. The police can ask a JP or Magistrate to allow them to hold you and question you for a longer period of time. Remember, you can be held for questioning but you do not have to answer any questions, except your name, age and address. Who can I have with me during police questioning? Generally, if you are under 18 and questioned by police, you must have a ‘support person’ with you. The support person"

Who can I have with me during police questioning? Generally, if you are under 18 and questioned by police, you must have a ‘support person’ with you. The support person should be: • a parent or guardian • a lawyer • a person who is acting for you who works in an agency that deals with the law • a relative or friend you would like to have there. • If none of these are available, then a justice of the peace (JP). You should tell the police which person you would like to have with you. The police should also give you the opportunity to talk to this person in private (where they cannot overhear you) before the questioning starts. If you are arrested the police have to make a reasonable effort to contact your parents, the police must take note if they cannot contact your parents. If you are being questioned about a minor offence such as littering then a ‘support person’ is not required. How much do I have to tell police at the station? You still have the right to silence at the police station. Whether you agree to go with the police or you are under arrest, you do not have to make a statement or answer any questions (in writing, on video or audio). You have the right to say NO to any form of interview BUT you should give your correct name, address and age each time you are asked. The police have to try and contact Legal Aid or the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service before they interview you about a serious criminal offence (for example an offence that can"

The police have to try and contact Legal Aid or the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service before they interview you about a serious criminal offence (for example an offence that can be tried by a Judge and jury in the District or Supreme Court). If you do participate in a police interview about a serious criminal offence, then the police should record it on video or audio. The police will give you a copy of the DVD after the interview. It is important to keep this DVD. If the police are unable to record your interview, then they can write it down and read it back to you. If you don’t agree with anything in the statement you should tell them at the time and ask them to change it. The police must give you a copy of the written record at the time. Even if you answered the questions you do not have to sign what the police wrote down. Do not sign anything you have not read, do not understand, or do not agree with. You do not have to write any statement. Lying to the police can get you into more trouble. Am I entitled to make a phone call? Yes, as long as it is to speak with a support person or solicitor. © Youth Advocacy Centre Inc 2 What if I am charged with an offence?

Our youth justice system aims to provide a fair and balanced response to young people who come in contact with the law. We hold young people accountable for their actions, encourage them to integrate into the community, provide them with skills to create a better future for themselves, and promote community safety.

Contact with police If a young person is believed to have committed an offence, they may be cautioned by the police or given the opportunity to participate in a restorative justice conference (a facilitated meeting with a victim or their representative). Otherwise, the police may decide to start court proceedings. This means a young person would be charged and either given a notice to appear in court, or arrested and held in a watch-house or detention centre until they can be seen in court. https://www.youthjustice.qld.gov.au/parents-carers/youth-justice-system/supporting-your-child-through-the-youth-justice-system 1/8 26/08/2025, 15:32 Supporting your young person through the youth justice system | Department of Youth Justice and Victim Support Learn more about what happens when arrested (https://www.qld.gov.au/law/crime-and- police/being-arrested-and-police-custody).

What-are-rights-1.pdf,0,"What are ‘rights’? In 1990 the Australian Government entered an agreement to adopt the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CROC). This is a formal protection of human rights for children, that is, everyone under 18 years of age. This Convention is the most widely ratified human rights treaty in the world. This means that, along with many other countries in the world, Australia has agreed that people under 18 have rights, that is, they must be treated fairly and they also need some protections. Unfortunately, governments in Australia do not always ensure this happens. Here are some examples of rights which young people have under the Convention: • Right to a name, to be part of a country and to be known and cared for by your parents • Right to say what you think and to be listened to • Right to look for information, receive it and pass it on by writing, speaking, art, etc • Right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion • Right to meet with others and to join or form groups • Right to privacy • Right to not be abused, neglected or exploited • Right to the best possible health and medical care • Right to an education • Right to enjoy your own culture, religion and language • If you have been accused of breaking the law, the right to be treated with respect and to have legal help • If you are in care, the right to suitable alternative care with a family or institution and for regular checks that this is working well for you. You can see more on the Convention on the UNICEF website. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) should check that the Convention on the Rights of the Child"

The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) should check that the Convention on the Rights of the Child is being followed and you can contact them if you are having hassles. Queensland also has a Human Rights Act (the Act) which includes some of these rights and others. These rights apply regardless of your skin colour, sex, religion, disability etc. The Act sets out some important rights that apply to young people under 18, including the right to privacy, education and protection, the right to enjoy culture and language, right to legal advice and representation, being held separately from adults if in custody on a charge, and the right to go to trial as quickly as possible.1 The Youth Justice Act overrides some of these rights. 1 Human Rights Act 2019 (Qld) ss 25, 36, 26, 27, 28, 31, 33.

Searches The police do not have a general right to search you or your property or to come into the place where you are living. When a police officer searches you without a legal right to do so, in circumstances where you have not agreed to be searched, they may be breaking the law themselves (assault). If the police come into the place where you are living without your agreement and they have no legal right of entry they are trespassing. When can the police search me or my bag? The police can ask to search you (including on the street) if they have reason to believe that you have: • a drug • a weapon, knife or explosive • stolen property • property that you have as the result of breaking the law • things that can be used for breaking into places, cars or taking drugs • anything else which may be evidence of an offence (such as something that can be used to graffiti) • alcohol that has been supplied to a minor without responsible supervision • things that can be used to hurt yourself or someone else; OR if the police believe you are going to break a law about casinos, racing, betting or prisons.

UNDER REVIEW If the police give you a reason for the search (they tell you that they think you have got one of the things in the list above) even if you think it’s unfair, you should let the police search otherwise you could be charged with an offence. The police officer must first warn you that it is an offence to obstruct a police officer who is doing a lawful search. You can tell the police you are not consenting to the search but allowing it because they say they have a legal right for the search. You should contact a solicitor as soon as possible afterwards if you want to speak to someone about what happened. When can police search me with a hand held scanner? Police can stop and search you or your belongings for knives or other weapons using a hand held scanner. Police can do this without a warrant, but only where: - • they have been given lawful authority by a senior police officer to conduct the search in the area; and • the search occurs within certain areas such as night club precincts, public transport, railway platforms and bus interchanges. Before a police officer searches you, they must provide their identification to you if you ask for it. The police officer must tell you that you must allow them to search you with a hand held scanner to see if you a carrying a knife or other weapon. They must also give you written information about the search if you ask for it. When searching you, they must do it in the least invasive way and"

If the hand held scanner detects something, police can ask you to give the item to them or they can search you again using the hand held scanner. You should let the police search you and follow their directions. If you don’t, you could be charged with an offence. If you are unhappy with the search, contact a solicitor to talk about what happened and get some help. © Youth Advocacy Centre Inc. 1 Can I be strip searched in public? NO. Usually if you are in a public place the police can only ask you to take off a jacket or jumper, turn out your pockets or empty a bag. If they want you to remove any other clothing then the police officer (who must be of the same sex as you) should take you somewhere private. BUT if a police officer thinks that a search must be done straight away and it is urgent (for example, you have a bomb or a firearm or a knife hidden somewhere on your body) then a police officer can do an immediate strip search in public.

You should contact a solicitor as soon as possible afterwards if you want to speak to someone about what happened. Can I be searched inside my body for drugs? If the police have reason to believe that you have hidden drugs inside any part of your body, they may want you to undertake a body cavity search. This can only be done with your agreement or by an Order of the court. If you are under 18 your agreement to do this must be given in front of your parent or guardian, your lawyer, an adult friend or if none of these people are available, a Justice of the Peace. The search must be carried out by a doctor. You can ask for a non-police person to be with you during the search. The police may use ‘reasonable’ force so that the doctor can do these searches or take these samples. What kind of searches can be done at a watch house?

You can have someone with you when the doctor or dentist does this. Police can use ‘reasonable force’ so that the doctor or dentist can do this. Can the police take a DNA sample? Police are only allowed to take a DNA sample from you if they have a Court Order. The police need to tell you, your parent or guardian AND the Department of Youth Justice in writing before they ask the court to make this Order. If you have been told that the police want to do this, you should immediately talk to a lawyer or one of the agencies listed under ‘Who can help?’ Can my car be searched?

It is a good idea to follow the police around when they are searching so that you can watch what they do. Sometimes the police may not allow you to do this, BUT you should ask anyway. If they have a warrant, the police must have it with them and some written information about your rights and responsibilities.

At some point in our lives, everyone will experience vulnerability, adversity or trauma in different ways and to different extents. Latest research indicates that approximately 75 per cent of Australians have experienced at least one potentially traumatic event in their lifetime,1 with many experiencing two or more events. More than two-thirds of people will experience a potentially traumatic event by the age of 18 years.2 When talking about trauma, it is important to distinguish emotionally harmful or life-threatening and has a negative between a potentially traumatic circumstance and a effect on a person’s functioning and mental, physical, traumatic response.

Language matters Language is important. It shapes our perceptions, approaches and responses to trauma, and significantly influences people’s experiences. How we use language can communicate a sense of compassion, safety and care. However, an inappropriate use of language can inadvertently perpetuate harm and stigma. The preferences and interpretations of language can vary significantly among different stakeholders. Currently, there is no clear consensus on the language that is used to talk about trauma and related concepts in Queensland. As our knowledge of trauma, trauma-informed practice and healing is continuously emerging, a shared understanding of trauma and trauma-informed approaches is also evolving. This language is dynamic and continuously progressing. We will continue to work towards a shared and contemporary understanding of key terms and phrases. 6 The Queensland Trauma Strategy 2024–2029 What is trauma?

It encompasses the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual distress passed down through generations. Acknowledging truth is fundamental to healing.

Capacity and resourcing issues in these environments can further alienate and distress people. This underscores the need for systemic reform to reduce these effects and prevent additional trauma. It is critical that systems recognise the various aspects and points of contact that can be potentially unsafe for people and communities who have experienced traumatic events and circumstances. Without doing so, any intended positive outcomes are likely to be disrupted. Potentially unsafe aspects encompass the physical environment, legislative requirements, culture, practices, use of language, processes, policies and procedures. It is critical that understanding of system impacts is led from the perspective of the person, family and carers involved, through co-design, and by ensuring lived-living experience voices and needs are central.

State-school-exclusions.pdf,0,"State school exclusions Please note: the information in this sheet applies to state schools only. If you are attending a private school, the school will have its own processes for exclusion and you should ask for a copy of these. When can I be excluded? You can be excluded from school for:1 • persistent disobedience (repeatedly not doing what the teacher or principal asks you to do) • misbehaviour • conduct, even things done outside of school, that adversely affects other students or that is harmful to the proper running of the school such as being disruptive in class, damaging school property, fighting in the playground or possessing or dealing in drugs in or outside of school • being a risk to the safety or wellbeing of other students or staff. AND • your behaviour is so serious that being suspended is not enough. You can also be excluded if you are convicted of an offence. It doesn’t matter if the offence has nothing to do with the school or if it happened outside of school hours or even if it did not happen in Queensland and would not be in the best interests of other students and staff for you to be enrolled at the school.2 Usually principals will make the decision to exclude. If the principal thinks someone else needs to make the decision, then they can ask the head of Education Queensland, the Chief Executive, to consider excluding you.3 Exclusion is a last resort and should only be used where other ways to try and address your behaviour have failed. If you are charged with a very serious offence, you may be suspended or excluded as the first option because, for example, they think you may be a risk to other students or staff. 1 Education (General"

State school exclusions What happens if the Principal or the Chief Executive wants to exclude me? You cannot be excluded without written notice. You must first be given a written notice (Proposed Exclusion Notice) telling you that they intend to exclude you. This is usually a letter from the school,4 but the letter could come from the Chief Executive.5 If you have not already been suspended the notice will also say that you are suspended until a decision is made whether to exclude you or not. A principal can only exclude you from their school.6 A principal can exclude you for either up to 1 year or permanently.7 The Chief Executive can exclude you from all state schools or specific state schools for up to 1 year or permanently.8 You cannot be excluded for longer than the period set out in the written notice/letter.

Once you have been given the Proposed Exclusion Notice, if you haven’t already been suspended, you will be immediately suspended.9 The suspension lasts until a final decision of the proposed exclusion is made. Do I have to do school work while I am suspended while an exclusion decision is made? The Principal or Chief Executive must arrange for you to be able to access an educational program so you can continue with your education during the suspension.10 You will be assigned a Regional Case Manager who will support you to engage in another education or training program. What happens next? If you have been given a Proposed Exclusion Notice threatening to exclude you from your school, the person sending the notice has up to 20 days to make a decision about excluding you from that school.11 If the Chief Executive is considering excluding you from all state schools or specified state schools they have 30 days from when they send the Proposed Exclusion Notice to you to make a decision.12 The principal or Chief Executive must consider your reasons properly before making a final decision. If you want help to write a letter it is best to seek advice as soon as you get the Proposed Exclusion Notice. 4 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 293(2). 5 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 300(2). 6 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 291(1). 7 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 295(3). 8 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 302(3). 9 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) ss 293 (Principal), 300 (Chief Executive). 10 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) ss 294 (Principal),"

State school exclusions Do I have to put my reasons in writing? Usually your reasons need to be in writing. You can see if someone (like the guidance officer, or one of the agencies under ‘Who can I contact for support?’ below) can meet with you so you can explain why you shouldn’t be excluded. The guidance officer may help you write up the list of reasons you shouldn’t be excluded. If you do not agree with what has been written down DO NOT sign it. You should ask the guidance officer to change anything you don’t agree with before you sign it. Can I have more time to write my reasons for not being excluded? You can ask for more time to prepare your letter. You will only be given more time if you have good reasons. If they decide to give you more time it will usually only be a few days. What if the decision is not to exclude me? If the principal or Chief Executive decides not to exclude you, they must tell you this as soon as they can and advise you that your suspension is over and you can come back to school.13 You will be sent a letter which tells you this and the reasons for it.14 You may be put on a behaviour plan which you should follow or you will"

Returning to school If you are not excluded or your exclusion was not permanent, the principal may meet with you (and your parents) to talk about a plan for when you return to school. If you were already on a behaviour plan you will need to do what is in the plan when you return to school. What if the Principal or Chief Executive decides to exclude me? If you are excluded from a school you can ask the Chief Executive to review the decision. You must do this in writing. You have 30 days to make the submission starting from when you were given the written notice of your exclusion.15 You must clearly set out the reasons why you say the decision is wrong and any other information that supports your side of the story. Also look at the procedures about exclusion set out in the “Student Discipline Procedure” document on Education Queensland’s website at https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/attachment/student-discipline-procedure.pdf to see if the principal or Chief Executive has followed them. If the principal or Chief Executive have not followed those procedures you should include that information in the letter. Contact one of the agencies under ‘Who can I contact for support?’ below if you want help with the letter. You can also make an application to the Supreme Court for Judicial Review but you should talk to a lawyer if you are considering this. 13 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) ss 295(2)(a) (Principal), 302(2)(a) (Chief"

State school exclusions What can the Chief Executive do? The Chief Executive can:16 • confirm you are excluded • exclude you but make different decisions about how long you are excluded for OR where you are excluded from • cancel/set aside the decision (which means you are not excluded) and possibly make a different decision (such as suspend rather than exclude you).17 Once the Chief Executive makes a decision they must tell you as soon as they can. Within 7 days of telling you, they must also give you a written notice including the reasons for their decision. If you are allowed back at school, they will arrange for you to return to school. This can include an interview with the principal and your parents. What if I disagree with the decision of the Chief Executive? If the Chief Executive excludes you from one or some specific state schools (whether permanently of not) you can ask the Chief Executive to review that decision (consider everything everyone concerned has to say and to make a decision). You have 30 days to ask for the review18 and then the Chief Executive has 40 days from when they receive your letter to make a decision.19 While you are waiting you may be able to enrol in the School of Distance Education.

How does QCAT work? QCAT’s job is to review decisions made by government departments like the Department of Education. QCAT can review the decision by the Chief Executive to exclude you. You have 28 days after you get the notice telling you that you’re excluded to apply to QCAT for them to look at your case again.21 You will need to use QCAT Form 23 which you can find on the QCAT website www.qcat.qld.gov.au or by calling the number below. For help with filling out the form contact one of the people below. Once you send the form to QCAT they will send you a letter to let you know what is happening.

State school exclusions What do I have to do if I am not going to school? If you are excluded from all state schools, the Chief Executive has to arrange for you to have access to an educational program.22 This is usually called an ‘alternate education program’. What else can I do? You could contact the Queensland Ombudsman. It is their job to investigate complaints about Queensland Government Departments like Education Queensland. The Ombudsman may make recommendations to Education Queensland after their investigation of your complaint. If you are permanently excluded from school you can also write to the Chief Executive each year up until you turn 24 asking for the decision to be revoked.23 You may be able to go back to school if you are able to show that your behaviour has improved or you are no longer a risk to school staff or students. The Chief Executive has forty (40) days to consider your submission and tell you the decision.24 22 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 304. 23 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 315. 24 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 315(4).

Family.pdf,0,"Family What are my parents' responsibilities? It is expected that your parents will care for you until you reach 18. Your parents are able to make decisions for you BUT as you get older, you have the right to have a say in decisions about you and their role should become more about giving advice. The law says that when you are under 16 your parents or carer must: • provide you with food, clothing, and shelter • protect you from risk to your personal safety and health • ensure you go to school • ensure you are not left unsupervised for an unreasonable length of time if you are under 12.1 If your parents do not look after you properly and Child Safety Services believes you are at risk of harm, then they may ask a court to grant a Child Protection Order.2 If the court does this then Child Safety Services can become your carer or guardian. Parents can discipline you, but they could be charged by the police if they go too far; for example, if they hit you anywhere hard enough to leave bruises or if they hit you anywhere on the head.3 Also if discipline causes injuries or psychological damage then Child Safety Services may also want to apply for a Child Protection Order.4 Who is my legal guardian? Your birth parents are usually your legal guardians until you reach 18,5even if you leave home, unless: • there is a Family Court Order about who is your legal guardian • you have a Child Protection Order (then your parents or Child Safety Services may be your legal guardian) • you are adopted (then your adoptive parents are your legal guardians) • your birth father is not named on your birth certificate and there is no"

They can do this by a written agreement (a Parenting Plan or Consent Order).7Consent Orders need to be approved by the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia and can be enforced by the law.8 If your parents cannot agree then the court will have to decide these things and make a Parenting Order.9 The court will consider what you want to happen and look at what is best for you. Sometimes this may be done through a solicitor called an Independent Children’s Lawyer. Independent Children’s Lawyers are appointed by the court. Their role is to tell the court your wishes and also to tell the court what they think is best for you after collecting information about your situation from a variety of people. Who pays maintenance if my parents split up? If your parents are separated, maintenance is now generally done through the Child Support Agency.10 The money is paid to the parent or adult with whom you are living.11 It is not possible for you to claim maintenance from the Child Support Agency. If you have issues about claiming money to support yourself from a parent where your parents have separated, you may be able to go to court. See a lawyer for advice. Can my parents cut me out of their will? You have the right (no matter what your age) to apply to a court for money out of your deceased parent's estate.

You can get details about your birth parents including full names and dates of birth. You will only get their addresses if your birth parents say this is ok. You can then contact your birth parents. Remember you can get into trouble if you harass, annoy or threaten them. To get this information contact the state government adoption services in the Department of Families, Seniors, Disability Services and Child Safety. If your birth parent has said they do not want their details to be given out to you and do not want any contact with you, you will not get the information you asked for. If they are prepared to have the details given to you but do not want to be contacted, then you will get the information you wanted.13 When can I change my name? You may use any name you wish as long as you don't intend to defraud anyone (e.g. try to get more money from Centrelink). If you are under 18, you should get your parents’ agreement. It is not necessary to register your change of name with the Registry of Births, Deaths, and Marriages. It is enough just to use the new name. However, this does not change your legal name.

If you are under 18 you can usually only change your first name once before you turn 18 but your second name can be changed once every 12 months or more often if there is a real need to change. Once you turn 18 you may apply to register a new name.

If a young person is granted bail, they will be released into the community straight away. They will have to sign a document to say that they will come back to court when they are told to. Sometimes a young person’s bail will have conditions such as: a curfew reporting to their local police station on a regular basis taking part in our conditional bail program. Conditional bail program Our conditional bail program helps a young person to comply with their bail conditions until their next court date. As part of the program, we will give a young person help and support to reduce their risk of offending or breaching their bail conditions. We do this by getting a young person to take part in positive activities and helping them to access services and develop skills. Who is it for A conditional bail program is for young offenders who the court thinks are at risk of not following their bail conditions. If the court does not give a young person a conditional bail program, they might be put in detention while they are on remand.

How to get one A young person’s legal representative will make an application for bail for the young person. They will ask us to suggest a suitable program to the court. Our youth justice officers will talk to you and the young person to develop the conditional bail program. We will then give it to the court to consider. If the court grants bail with a condition that the young person participates in a conditional bail program, a young person will go to their local youth justice centre (https://www.qld.gov.au/law/sentencing-prisons-and-probation/young-offenders-and-the- justice-system/youth-justice-in-queensland/youth-justice-centre-locations)to meet with youth justice officers and discuss the days, times and details of their program. What is involved A conditional bail program can give a young person help and support from a youth justice officer for up to 32 hours per week. The youth worker will help a young person develop skills and access services that will help them in the future, including: TAFE or other education apprenticeships, traineeships or work skills programs cultural development programs sporting and recreational programs health services life skills and social skills programs community supports. https://www.youthjustice.qld.gov.au/parents-carers/youth-justice-system/sentencing-young-offenders/bail-and-bail-with-conditions 2/4 26/08/2025, 15:31 Bail and Bail with conditions | Department of Youth Justice and Victim Support Rules It is important that a young person understands that the program is a condition of their bail.

A young person must agree to participate and follow the lawful instructions of a youth justice officer. If a young person does not do what the bail conditions say, they could be arrested by police and taken back to court. If a young person does not participate as required, they may be in breach of their bail and have to go back to court. The court may decide to place a young person in custody until their next court date. Committing an offence on bail It is important that a young person does not offend while on bail. If a young person is on bail and they commit another offence there are consequences. This can also influence the court when it decides whether it's best to: grant further bail for the young person; or remand them in custody in a detention centre to stop them from committing other offences.

Getting-my-stuff-back-Updated-November-2023-WM1.pdf,0,"GETTING MY STUFF BACK This sheet is intended to provide general legal information about the law in Queensland. This information is not legal advice. If you have a particular legal problem you should contact a solicitor for legal advice. At the end is a list of agencies that might be able to assist you, including legal agencies. Sometimes when you leave where you are staying, you might have to leave some things behind. Here are some ways to try to get those things back. Make a list Start by making a list of everything that’s yours that you want back. E.g. your phone, clothes, shoes, DVDs, CDs, books - anything you might have bought for yourself or that was given to you. When you are making this list you should keep a couple of things in mind. Does the thing belong to me or to someone else? One way to figure this out is based on who paid for it. If you paid for it, it’s yours but it will help if you have receipts or can show in your banking records that you paid for it. If someone else paid for it but it was a gift, for example a Christmas or birthday present, you may have a right to it. Sometimes if you attach something permanently to the property you will lose ownership of it. Examples of this may include putting up shelves, installing air conditioning systems or toilets. Ask a lawyer if you are not sure if you own an item of property. If you leave a place owing rent it is an offence for the owner of the house to sell your property to cover the rent debt.

For example, you might decide that you don’t really need your football but your warm clothes or shoes are really important. Once you have made a list, it might be worth talking to a youth worker to get some advice about the things you have decided to include or not include in your list. What is against the law when I try to get my stuff back? You can try to get your things back yourself but you should know that the following things are against the law: • Trespass - If you no longer live at the address and you have not been given permission to enter the house you could be trespassing by going into the house. • Breaking and Entering – if you break into a house and then take something which might not actually be yours, you could be charged for Breaking and Entering as well as Stealing. • Burglary – if you enter the house planning on committing an offence such as stealing or you commit an offence in the dwelling you could be charged with Burglary. • Wilful Damage - if you do damage to someone’s property while trying to get your property back you could be charged with Wilful Damage. • Assault – getting into a fight over the things"

Try talking to whoever has your stuff calmly about the things that you want. It might help to have a trusted adult to support you during this talk. See if they will agree on a time to go to collect your belongings or if they will drop it somewhere safe for you to pick up. © Youth Advocacy Centre Inc 1 More options If it is not possible to get your things back yourself or to talk to the person without the risk of getting into trouble or because there is a risk to your safety, you still have options. Can I call the Police? If you think that someone is holding your property without your permission you can contact the police. If the police think someone is breaking the law they may get your stuff and charge the person. When the police are trying to decide if someone has your stuff illegally, they may want some proof to show that you own the property like receipts or bank records. You can also tell them how, when and where you got the thing to help the police understand it is yours. If the police think they do not have enough evidence to charge the person, you can still ask the police to come with you to get your things.

If the police think they do not have enough evidence to charge the person, you can still ask the police to come with you to get your things. The police may try to help make sure things don’t get out of hand but they cannot force the person to give your things back. Can I get legal advice? You can seek legal advice and ask a lawyer to write a letter of demand to the person who has your stuff asking them to give your things back within a period of time and advising them that if they don’t that you will go to court. What about going to court? You can go to court to get a judge to make an Order to the person to return your property, but it is best to get legal advice first before going to court. If you are under 18 you cannot make a claim against someone else without a litigation guardian. This is an adult who agrees to pay court costs if you are ordered to pay costs and whose name will be on the court documents. Usually, a parent would be the litigation guardian but this won’t be possible if you are claiming against your parents. Who can help?

A vehicle is any type of transport with wheels and includes: • motor vehicle • bicycle • a non-motorised ‘wheeled recreational device’ {rollerblades, roller-skates, skateboard, and scooter (including a foot scooter with an electric motor less than 200 watts)}. What is a motor vehicle? Motor vehicles are cars, motorbikes, jet skis, boats and any other vehicle with an engine but not motorised scooters or bicycles. What if I am driving and I have been drinking or taking drugs? It is an offence for you to have any alcohol at all and drive or try to drive a motor vehicle if you are a learner (on L Plates) or a person on P Plates, as your blood-alcohol level has to be 0.00. When you are off your P plates, the limit is generally 0.05. But this does not apply if driving is your job; or if you are on a probationary licence following your driver’s licence being suspended. It is also an offence to drive, try to drive, or be ‘in charge’ of – • A motor vehicle anywhere if you are affected by alcohol, illegal drugs, or legal drugs which a doctor has prescribed for you. • Any other type of vehicle it is an offence if you are on a road.

UNDER REVIEW So, it would be an offence to be ‘under the influence’ of (affected by) drugs or alcohol and have your skateboard at the local shopping centre car park but this would not be the case if you were on the grassed area of the local park. (BUT: you could still be picked up for being drunk in a public place). What does being ‘in charge’ of a motor vehicle mean? Being ‘in charge’ of a motor vehicle can include having the keys to a car or being the only person in the car even though the engine isn’t running. Being asleep in the back of a parked car can be enough for police to charge you if the police breath test you, and you are over the limit that applies to you. Can I ride my bicycle if affected by drugs or alcohol? No. It is an offence to be affected by drugs or alcohol and be in charge of any vehicle like a bicycle or animal on a road such as a horse. When can the police ask for a breath test? A police officer can stop you and ask you to take a breath test if: • you are driving or trying to drive a motor vehicle (car, motorbike, jet ski, any other vehicle with an engine or a boat) • you are the person who seems to be ‘in charge’ of the motor vehicle • the police officer believes that, during the three hours before asking you to take the breath test, you drove or tried to drive a motor vehicle or were in charge of"

For any vehicle (including bicycle, rollerblades, roller skates, skateboard, and scooter), if a police officer has arrested you because they think that you are affected by alcohol – for example because of the way you are driving or riding – the officer can ask you to take a breath test. For any vehicles (including scooters and bicycles), police can ask to take a breath test in certain situations such as if you are arrested for:- • driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol; or © Youth Advocacy Centre Inc 1 • driving carelessly or dangerously resulting in an accident. Can I refuse to take a breath test? It is an offence to refuse to take a breath test. If the police want to breath test you in relation to a motor vehicle, and you refuse to take the test, you may also be charged with a more serious drink driving offence even though you may not have had any alcohol at all. The police officer can take you to the nearest police station - by using reasonable force if necessary. What about saliva, blood, or urine tests?

There are similar laws for saliva tests for drugs and driving as for breath tests. You could also be asked to take a blood or a urine test if the police think your behaviour shows you are affected by alcohol or drugs but the levels of the breath or saliva tests you took were low or nil. You can be charged with an offence if you refuse to take these tests. These tests must be done by a doctor or a nurse. What will happen if the police think I have been drinking or taking drugs? If the police believe you were driving, trying to drive or were ‘in charge’ of any vehicle when affected by alcohol or drugs; or you have an alcohol limit above what applies to you for a motor vehicle, then: • you can be arrested, taken to the police station and have to go to court • if found guilty, you can be given a fine or another sentence. If you are found guilty of offences involving a motor vehicle: • your licence can be cancelled • you can be disqualified from holding a licence for a certain amount of time. Who can help?

What to do if I’m unhappy with my Child Protection Order Making decisions for myself If you are in the care of Child Safety then some decisions that are really important will be decided by a group of adults and you. These decisions are usually made at a Family Group Meeting. At this meeting, your parents, carers, Child Safety Officer (the person from Child Safety whose job is to make sure your needs are met), cultural representative, your youth worker, your lawyer and you talk about what you need to have a good life. This is put into a case plan which says things like who you live with and where you go to school. As you get older you may get better at making decisions.

These are: • not to let your parents know where you are living. • to limit or stop you from seeing your parents, brother or sister. • that you are to live with a particular person or in a particular place. • that you are no longer allowed to live with a person who was your carer. • refusing to review your case plan when requested if you are under a long-term Guardianship Order. To have the decision reviewed means that the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT) will look into the decision. Other people, like your parents or carers, can also ask for a decision to be reviewed. There will be a day where you can go to QCAT (you can take a support person; you don’t need a lawyer but you can have one if you wish) and say what you think should happen. The decision can either be changed or be left as it is. It is the job of QCAT to give you information and help so you can apply for a review and participate in the process. You have only 28 days after you get the letter from Child Safety telling you about the decision to put your application for a review in at QCAT.

What if I am unhappy with the Child Protection Order? (CPO) A Child Protection Order can be made by the Childrens Court if the court decides that you are unsafe and there is not a parent able to make you safe at the moment. The aim of the Order is to make you safe. If the court makes a CPO about you and you disagree with it, you can ask the court to cancel or change the Order. For the court to cancel the Order you will need to show the court that you will be safe from harm without a CPO. For the court to change your CPO you will have to show the court that the change you want to make will still keep you safe from harm.

While this is happening the court can say that Child Safety will decide where you are to live or that Child Safety can come and check on your safety. The court might decide that you are to live with someone other than your parents until a final Order is made. If you disagree with this you may be able to appeal. This appeal must be made within 28 days of the court making this Order. You will need some help with this appeal so it is best to call one of the lawyers at the end of this sheet.

Sex.pdf,0,"Sex When can I have sex? You can have sex with a person (of the same or different sex) without breaking the law if you are both 16 and over and you both want to do this.1It is against the law for two (or more) people to have sex if any (or all) of them are under 16.2 It is unlawful for a person to do any of the following to a young person under 16: • touch the young person on the genitals, bottom or chest or somewhere else in a sexual way • expose themselves to the young person • take inappropriate photos of the young person.3 It is against the law for a parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, brother or sister to have sex with you.4 This is called incest. It includes that group if you are related through a de facto relationship, step family, adopted family or foster family.5It is also against the law to have sex with an animal.6 If the police or Child Safety Services believe you are at risk of harm because of your sexual behaviour, they may ask the Court to order that you be placed in the care and protection of Child Safety Services.7 Get some legal advice if you think this might happen. If any adult, including your parents, has reasonable belief that a sexual offence has occurred to child under 16 (or under 18 if the child has a disability) then they must report it to the police.8 What is safe sex? ‘Safe sex’ means not swapping any bodily fluids with the person you are having sex with.

Sex When can I get contraceptives? There is no age limit for buying contraceptives (for example the Pill, condoms) BUT young women will need to get a prescription from a doctor or some pharmacists for contraceptives such as the Pill. Generally, you may receive contraceptive advice and treatment without your parents being told. You should check your pharmacist or doctor’s practice if this is an issue for you. Usually, the Family Planning Association will respect your right to privacy and will not contact your parents. What about my parents? If a doctor agrees to treat you, including"

Usually, the Family Planning Association will respect your right to privacy and will not contact your parents. What about my parents? If a doctor agrees to treat you, including providing you with contraception, then the doctor must keep information about you confidential (this might apply to a pharmacist providing you with contraception). This means that information about you should not be given to anyone else without your agreement. This includes your parents unless the doctor believes you are not able to understand the treatment and its consequences. If you are unsure who to trust, contact one of the agencies listed under ‘Who can I Contact for Support?’ STIs? Anybody can get an STI (a sexually transmitted infection) by having unprotected sex with someone who is infected. STIs (for example, HIV, genital warts, herpes or hepatitis) are very common, and you can catch them easily. You are much less likely to catch an STI from kissing, hugging or massage. It is important to see a doctor if you have had unprotected sex and you think you may have an STI. If you have an STI and do not tell the person you are having sex with, you can be committing an offence for infecting someone else.9 What if I'm pregnant? It is a good idea to talk to someone you trust about what you want to do, as there are choices and you need to understand what those choices will mean for you.

If you do not have anyone you can trust contact one of the agencies listed under ‘Who Can Help?’ In Queensland it is legal to have an abortion up to twenty-two weeks of pregnancy. After twenty-two weeks two doctors “sign off” before the abortion can be performed. If the doctor has agreed to treat you then the doctor must keep information about you confidential, that is, not tell anyone unless you agree. Anyone wanting to stop you having a legal abortion or trying to make you have an abortion that you don't want would need to ask a court to order this. You should tell the doctor what you want to happen and see a lawyer if you are worried about what may be happening. Can I be forced to have sex? NO. If you are forced to have sex against your will this is called rape or sexual assault and it is against the law. (See sheet on ‘Victim of Crime’ for more information about this). It includes a wide variety of acts such as oral sex, touching another’s genitals, and groping. Factors including the use of alcohol may affect whether you are able to consent to the sexual activity. Rape or sexual assault is not something that can only happen with a stranger – date rape can happen when the person you are dating forces you into sexual activity that you do not want.

You should get support from someone you trust or contact one of the agencies listed under ‘Who Can I Contact for Support ?’ to find out what you can do if this happens to you. What if I'm a sex worker? It is not against the law for you to work as a sex worker however if you are under 18, any person who gets commercial (for money) sexual services from you commits an offence. It is against the law for a person to provide commercial sexual services to any person under 18.10 You can legally carry as much safe sex material (like condoms) as you wish. If you do contract certain STIs and are aware of it, it is against the law to put someone at risk of getting it.11 There are health and safety issues for sex workers. If you are under 18 and working as a sex worker the police or Child Safety Services may decide that you are at risk of harm and apply to the court for a Child Protection Order and put you in the care of Child Safety Services.

Assault-and-Bullying-YAC-Infosheet.pdf,0,"Assault and Bullying What is assault? A person can be charged with assault in Queensland if they apply force to another without their consent or threaten to apply force to another person. The person charged must appear to have the ability to carry out the threat. You can be charged with assaulting a person even if you did not actually touch them, but you did move/act towards them in a way that would make them feel afraid of violence. The more harm you cause a person when you assault them, the more serious the charge against you can be. For example, • If you hit a person and they do not suffer injury you may be charged with ‘common assault’. • If you hit a person and cause an injury, you may be charged with assault causing bodily harm. • If you hit a person and they bleed, you may be charged with ‘wounding’. • If you hit a person, and you cause an injury that will not heal without medical help you can be charged with ‘grievous bodily harm’. If someone hits me first, can I hit back to protect myself? Yes, but you will have to be able to show that any force you used was needed to defend yourself or somebody else. Can I be charged if I agree to a fight? Yes, you can. It is illegal to be in a fight in public. In some circumstances even if you agree to be in a fight, you may be charged if you injure somebody. This can include fights at school and fights at sporting activities. What is bullying and can I get in trouble for it?

It is a unique response to the extremely high rates of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people in the youth justice system. The board was established in February 2016 to help the department develop culturally appropriate ways to reduce over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the youth justice system. Composition of the board The FNAB is made up of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander Youth Justice staff members from across Queensland. They work in a range of positions from frontline staff to managers. Every member is a strong advocate and leader within Youth Justice and their local communities. Impact on Youth Justice The FNAB has already had a significant impact on our work. A cultural unit based in our central office helps us ensure that priorities are put into practice. It aims to make sure that the way we work takes cultural factors into account and enhances our workforce cultural capability. Representatives sit on the Executive Board of Management to ensure Youth Justice policy, programs and interventions are appropriate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people, their families and communities. https://www.youthjustice.qld.gov.au/our-department/who-we-are/governance/action-board 1/2 26/08/2025, 15:56 First Nations Action Board | Department of Youth Justice and Victim Support Future goals Members of the FNAB hope to inspire similar initiatives across all Australian states and territories.

If you have a particular legal problem you should contact a solicitor. Each section ends with a list of agencies who might be able to assist you, including legal agencies. This legal information is relevant to Queensland, Australia. Alcohol and cigarettes It is against the law for anyone to sell or give alcohol or cigarettes to anyone under 18. If you are under 18 and in your house then an adult can give you alcohol provided they are your parent or standing in for your parent. The adult must be responsible for you and make sure you are safe – they must not be drunk and must watch how much you drink and how quickly and whether you are eating while you drink. The adult can be charged if they are not supervising you properly and the police can take the alcohol. If you put alcohol or a drug, or something you think is alcohol or a drug, in a person’s drink without their knowledge you could be charged with drink spiking. It is against the law for anyone to be drunk in public and to drink in public. It is against the law to smoke in many places, including in a car if there is anyone under 16 in the car. If you are under 18 you cannot have alcohol, even an unopened bottle, in your possession in a public place. Police can take the alcohol from you and, if it is open, pour it out.

It is against the law to pretend to be 18 to buy alcohol, vapes or cigarettes, e.g. by using a false ID. Other drugs It is against the law for anyone to be under the influence of drugs in public. It is against the law to possess any amount of illegal drugs no matter how small or if it is only for personal use. It is also illegal to possess things (utensils) that have been or are being used to take drugs, such as syringes, spoons and bongs. Possession includes having the drugs or things in your control e.g. in your car. UNDER REVIEW If there is a reasonable suspicion that things in your possession are connected to using drugs, then it is up to you to prove to the court that the things were not connected to drug use. If you are having a party and someone brings drugs or utensils to the party then you can be charged with an offence even if you didn’t know the drugs were there. If you did not know the drugs or utensils were on your property it is up to you to prove that to the court. If you are sharing drugs you can be charged with a serious offence – supplying dangerous drugs. Noise There is no set time for when you have to stop making noise at a party but if someone nearby feels the noise is too loud they can call the police. If the police think the noise is too loud they can come inside the house and direct you stop the noise immediately.

If the police think the noise is too loud they can come inside the house and direct you stop the noise immediately. If the noise continues after the police leave and the police come back they can take away the thing causing the noise e.g. portable speakers. Once police are in the house they can take action if anything illegal is happening, for example if they are there about noise but someone is using drugs they can charge them. Fights Touching someone or hitting them with something without their consent is an assault, for example pouring a can of soft drink over someone. If someone is seriously injured or killed you can be charged with a very serious offences, even if you think they wanted to fight you. If you are not actually in the fight but you are encouraging the fight you could be charged as well. The penalties for assaulting certain people are much higher, for example spitting on or biting police is up to 14 years imprisonment. You are entitled to defend yourself if you are attacked or to help someone else defend themselves, so long as you only use enough force to reasonably defend yourself or the other person. If you badly injure the other person it will be harder to show you used “reasonable” force. © Youth Advocacy Centre Inc Street Offences There are lots of laws about how people must behave in public including walking along the street or driving in a car.

As well as charging you police can move you on from public places and stop you coming back for up to 24 hours if you are you are making anyone feel anxious or disrupting the orderly conduct of an event, even if you aren’t doing anything. It is an offence to disobey a lawful direction given to you by police. The police must give you their name, rank and station when ordering you to move on. If you want to avoid drawing police attention to you in public you should remember these rules. Searches Police have powers which allow them to search you or your bags without a warrant, for example if they reasonably suspect you have drugs, a weapon or stolen property on you If police want to search you they have to “detain” you and tell you why. Before doing a search they should ask if you will agree. It is up to you whether you agree to the police doing a search, for example turning out your pockets for them, but if you do agree anything they find can be used as evidence in court. If you feel pressured into letting the police search then it is possible the court might say the search was unlawful. Asking you to take off outer clothing is not a strip search. Police cannot strip search you without a support person (parent or adult) being there unless it is an emergency.

Sex and sexting Having sex (including anal sex) under 16 is a serious offence. It doesn’t matter if you both want to have sex and you are both under 16. As well as sex it is also against the law to do sexual things to each other (like touching genitals). It is against the law for a parent, grandparent, brother or sister (including adopted or step siblings and foster siblings) to have sex with you. This is called UNDER REVIEW incest. There are also laws against taking and sharing indecent photos or videos of people under 16, even if they agree. This can include sending images of yourself. Child pornography is text, images or sound showing a person under 16 in a sexual way that is likely to offend an adult. It includes images of • the person’s breasts, bottom, penis or vagina; or • the person doing something sexual or near someone doing something sexual (such as having sex). Dealing with Police Police are not always in uniform. If a person in plain clothes says they are police ask for their ID. If a uniformed police officer is not wearing a name badge ask them their name and what station they are from. Stay cool and calm if the police approach you and treat them with respect.

You must agree, before the court can order you to do any of the orders below, except for detention. If you do not agree, the court will give you another order which might include detention. Unsupervised Orders 1. Drug Assessment and Education Session If you are charged with having some small quantities of drugs and utensils, you may be eligible to attend a Drug Assessment and Education Session. You must agree to do this session before the court can order you to go. The session may take about 2 hours. You will be told at court the date and the place where you need to go to see the drug counsellor. If you go to the session, then the matter will not go back to court and a conviction will not be recorded (see the ‘What if I am convicted?’ factsheet for more information). If you do not go to the session, then you must go back to court and another order can be made. 2. Restorative Justice Process Instead of sentencing you, the court can order that you take part in a restorative justice conference or attend an alternative diversion program. At a restorative justice conference, you will have the opportunity to discuss the consequences of committing the offence with the people who were affected by it, such as the victim.

At the conference you will be asked to reach an agreement fix the impact of what you did. For example: • agree to pay the victim some money • apologise • do some voluntary work • get some counselling An alternative diversion program is something designed to help you understand the harm caused by your behaviour and give you opportunity to take responsibility for the offence you committed.

No conviction will be recorded. 4. Good Behaviour Order This requires that you to not break the law for a period of time up to one year. No conviction will be recorded. If you commit an offence while on a Good Behaviour Order, the court will consider that you did not stay out of trouble as you agreed when sentencing you for the new offence/s. 5. Fine. If a court believes you have your own money (for example, because you have a job) then it may order you to pay a sum of money as a punishment. A conviction can be recorded against you.

This is called a pre-sentence report. The report will outline what you will be required to do under the Order. This is called the ‘program’. You need to understand what you will have to do under the program and you should ask a lawyer to explain the program to you.

Detention Order A court can order you to spend time in a youth detention centre, which is a jail for people under 18. The court must first get a report about you from a Youth Justice caseworker. This is called a pre-sentence report. If you are found guilty of an offence by a Magistrate then generally you can be sentenced to detention for up to 12 months. If you are found guilty of an ‘adult crime, adult time’ offence then you can be sentenced to detention for up to 3 years (see our ‘adult crime, adult time’ information sheet). If you are found guilty of an offence before a Judge, depending on how serious the charge is, they can sentence you to a number of years in detention. The time varies and, in some circumstances, (for example, murder) you can be sentenced to life in detention. If you are found guilty of an ‘adult crime, adult time’ offence then you can be sentenced to detention for the same maximum period that an adult can be sent to prison (see our ‘adult crime, adult time’ information sheet).

A court can also order an earlier release date (up to 50% of your sentence). Unless you are sentenced for an ‘adult crime, adult time’ offence, the court can order your release at any time. When you are released, you will be put on a Supervised Release Order. You must also comply with the other conditions of the order. For example you must: • not leave the State of Queensland without approval of your Youth Justice caseworker • not break the law • do as your caseworker tells you • tell your caseworker if you change address, your school or job.

If you have previously been sentenced to at least one detention order for certain serious offences, the Court can declare that you are a ’serious repeat offender’.

The Court after considering the above matters, can only declare that you are ‘serious repeat offender’ if it thinks there is a high probability you will commit a further offence. If you are declared a serious repeat offender, the declaration will remain current for 12 months. It will also impact how the Court sentences you especially if you commit further certain serious offences during this period.

This means that even after you turn 18 people can be told about this offence. This may cause problems, for example, when you try to get a job or want to travel overseas. If you do not break the law again for five years, in some situations you may be able to say that you have no conviction. You must see a lawyer before you say this to make sure this is correct for your situation as there are many circumstances after 5 years where this will not apply. You could be committing an offence of fraud by wrongly denying you have a conviction. When can I be sent to jail? You cannot be sent to an adult jail if you are under 18, but you can be sent to a youth detention centre. Once you turn 18 you will be moved an adult prison. If you are moved to an adult jail, you must still be released on the date your Supervised Release Order would have started (see the section Make a Detention Order). You may be placed on parole. Parole means being allowed to live in the community under the supervision of a parole officer for the rest of your sentence. If you do not do what you are told by the parole officer or your Parole Order, you can be sent back to prison. If you are sentenced to life imprisonment, the rules for adults surrounding parole apply. Can I be made to go to counselling?

You may be ordered to attend counselling under the following: • Drug Diversion Assessment Program • Probation Order • Conditional Release Order • Intensive Supervision Order Can I be ordered to pay restitution or compensation? A court can make you pay for any damage done, such as the cost of replacing damaged property or for medical costs or compensation for injury. A court can only do this if you have the money to pay for it. Restitution or compensation is not a sentence; it is for the victim of the offence to be paid for what they have lost or suffered and so the court can also make one of the other Orders listed above at the same time. Your parents can also be ordered to pay for damage or injury caused by you if it seems you broke the law because your parents did not supervise you properly.

What happens if the police believe I have broken the law? If you are under 18 and the police believe you have broken the law, then they can take you to court for your matter to be dealt with. What if the police decide to take me to court? The police will consider the following in deciding whether to charge and send you to court: • whether you admitted you broke the law • how much trouble you have been in, in the past • how serious the matter is. If the police: • Summons you: you are allowed to leave the police station but later the police will bring some papers (the summons) around to you. These papers will tell you where and when you must go to court; or • Give you a Notice to Appear: they give you a form (Notice to Appear) ‘on the spot’ and will tell you when and where you must go to court.

If you are unsure who to call, you can phone one of the agencies under ‘Who can help?’ If bail is refused and you are under 18 you should be placed in a youth detention centre or watch house. When you get to court, you can ask the court to give you bail until your case is resolved. What if I am put in a watch house? If you are under 18, the police should make sure you are: • separated from adults (unless the police think it is better for you that you be with an adult) • safe at all times • not kept in a watch house longer than is necessary (if you cannot be taken to court, you must be taken to a youth detention centre).

The police can take your fingerprints, palm prints, footprints and voiceprints (‘identifying particulars’), and photograph you and any tattoos, old and new injuries and other things on your body that may be used to identify you if you are arrested and charged. They can also take your photograph at the place where you are arrested. If you are given a summons or Notice to Appear and the police want to take your prints, they will have to get a Court Order. You can argue that you should not have to give the prints and you should get a lawyer © Youth Advocacy Centre Inc 1 to help you. If the court orders you to give your prints and you do not do so, you can be charged and the police can arrest you. If you give your prints under a Court Order you must have one of the people listed under ‘Who can I have with me during a police questioning?’ with you. Can the police keep my prints & photographs? If you were arrested and charged and you have not been in trouble for other offences, then your prints and photographs must be destroyed if: • the police decide later not to take your case to court • the court decides you did not break the law.

Should I get legal advice? If the police want to arrange for you and your parent to come down to the police station to be questioned, then you should get legal advice before you attend an interview. It is useful to have a lawyer with you during the police questioning. If you have to go to court you should get legal advice. This will help you to understand if you have broken the law, and what your choices are in answering questions. If you are in a youth detention centre, you can ask your caseworker to arrange for you to get legal advice.

Security officers are not police officers and do not have the same powers. For example, they can arrest you for breaking the law (as can anyone), but they will need to be very sure you have committed an offence or you can take them to court for false arrest and assault. If they do arrest you, they must hand you over to the police as soon as possible. They cannot search you, take your prints or do other things the police have the power to do. Security can order you to leave private property (which includes shopping centres) and use reasonable force to make you leave if you do not go when you are asked. At Southbank in Brisbane, security officers have special powers to ban people from the park. By law, a person cannot work as a security officer or bouncer if they ‘show dishonesty or a lack of integrity, use harassing tactics or have been convicted of a criminal offence’. You do not have to give your personal details to a security guard. Some exceptions apply to this general rule. Security guards can ask for ID for proof of age if they believe that you are below 18 and on a licenced premise. You are also required to provide your name and address if you are trespassing.

Bail.pdf,0,"Bail What is bail? If you are arrested and charged with an offence then you may be: • held in custody until your next court date OR • you may be granted bail, which means that you can live in the community, until your next court date. Bail is a written agreement (you have to consent) that you will come to court on your next court date. If you don’t agree to some of the conditions then you may not get bail. When do I get bail? If you are arrested and charged by police, they can give you bail.1 If the police do not give you bail then you can ask the court to give you bail.2 For help with a bail application, speak to a lawyer. See ‘who can help’ at the end of this sheet. How do I get a lawyer to help me get bail? You can call one of the legal services listed at the end of this fact sheet and they may be able to help you. If you are in custody, the police must tell a legal service that they want to question you (the legal service is free). What does the court or police think about when deciding whether to give me bail? The court or police will think about: • will you come to your next court date? • will you break the law (commit an offence) while you are on bail? • will you be a danger to someone or to the community generally? • will you speak to a witness in your matter or try to interfere with the police looking into your matter?3 The court or police will also consider: • how serious the charges are • your criminal history • who you spend time with (for example"

If the court or police have no way to keep you safe other than by keeping you in custody, because your life is at risk due to the offence you committed, then you will likely not be granted bail.7 What conditions can be put on my bail? The court or police can give you bail with conditions that you must follow.8 These conditions could be that: • you live at a certain place • you have a curfew during certain hours of the night (that means you are not allowed out of your house during those hours) • someone pays a certain amount of money if you don’t show up to court • you do not contact a particular person • you stay away from a certain place • you regularly check in at a youth justice service centre and sometimes a police station • you wear an electronic monitoring device (EMD).

A CBP is a program of activities (often 5-6 days a week) that you must do. You do not have to agree to do a CBP, but if you refuse to do a CBP you might not be given bail and you might have to stay in custody until your next court date. Can I get my bail conditions changed? Yes, you can. If you want to get your bail conditions changed (for example because you are changing address) speak to your lawyer about this. How do I find out what my bail conditions are? Your bail conditions are on the piece of paper you signed. You, your lawyer, or a trusted adult can contact the court or police who gave you bail to check what your bail conditions are.

If you have a particular legal problem you should contact a solicitor for legal advice. At the end is a list of agencies that might be able to assist you, including legal agencies. Shopping centres, parks and other public spaces are used by young people to hang out, meet friends and get from place to place. Young people and the things they do are often judged because they are in groups and use public space differently to adults. These views alongside the way they dress, the way they look, and what they do all impact on how they are treated. When can the police ask me to ‘move on’? You can be asked to move on if the police ‘reasonably suspect’ that your behaviour (or just you being where you are): • is causing or has caused anxiety to someone and that feeling of anxiety is reasonable in the cirucumstances • is or has been getting in the way of people going in or out of somewhere • is disrupting or has disrupted an event, entertainment or a gathering place and you are in or near: • a ‘public place’ • a ‘prescribed place’ – places which are named in the ‘move on’ laws • any Government owned place that has its own laws which say you can be moved on: for example, Southbank Parklands.

What is a ‘public place’ ? • anywhere which is not owned specifically by someone where people are legally able to go such as a road, park or beach • anywhere which is private property but which is often open to the public such as a café, shopping centre, restaurant or cinema. What is a ‘prescribed place’? • Shop • Child care centre, preschool and school • Hotel or place that sells alcohol • Railway station or land • ATM • Mall, for example Brisbane – China Town o Brisbane – City Mall o Ipswich – Ipswich Mall o Townsville – Townsville Mall o Gold Coast – Cavill Avenue o • Racecourse • War Memorial For example, you can be moved on by a police officer if a shop owner complains and you are blocking the entrance to a shop or disrupting the business in another way. What happens if the police want to move me on?

It is not reasonable to move you 100m if you are blocking the doorway of a shop, for example. Security and local council officers do not have the powers of police officers to move you from public or private places but they can ask you to leave and call the police if you do not go. Can security officers and local council officers move me on? Generally, security and local council officers do not have the powers of police officers to move you from public or private places, but they can ask you to leave and call the police if you do not go. If they are ‘protective services officers’ who provide security for Government buildings and connected surrounding areas, they have similar powers of police to move you on. They can do this if you: • Behave in a disorderly, indecent, offensive or threatening way to persons entering, at or leaving the building; or • Refuse to provide your name, address and reason for entering the building. • Refuse the officer’s request to be subject to security screening processes. • Do not have a lawful reason to enter or be at the building.

If you have a particular legal problem you should contact a solicitor. Each section ends with a list of agencies who might be able to assist you, including legal agencies. This legal information is relevant to Queensland, Australia. Alcohol and cigarettes It is against the law for anyone to sell or give alcohol or cigarettes to anyone under 18. If you are under 18 and in your house then an adult can give you alcohol provided they are your parent or standing in for your parent. The adult must be responsible for you and make sure you are safe – they must not be drunk and must watch how much you drink and how quickly and whether you are eating while you drink. The adult can be charged if they are not supervising you properly and the police can take the alcohol. If you put alcohol or a drug, or something you think is alcohol or a drug, in a person’s drink without their knowledge you could be charged with drink spiking. It is against the law for anyone to be drunk in public and to drink in public. It is against the law to smoke in many places, including in a car if there is anyone under 16 in the car. If you are under 18 you cannot have alcohol, even an unopened bottle, in your possession in a public place. Police can take the alcohol from you and, if it is open, pour it out.

It is against the law to pretend to be 18 to buy alcohol, vapes or cigarettes, e.g. by using a false ID. Other drugs It is against the law for anyone to be under the influence of drugs in public. It is against the law to possess any amount of illegal drugs no matter how small or if it is only for personal use. It is also illegal to possess things (utensils) that have been or are being used to take drugs, such as syringes, spoons and bongs. Possession includes having the drugs or things in your control e.g. in your car. UNDER REVIEW If there is a reasonable suspicion that things in your possession are connected to using drugs, then it is up to you to prove to the court that the things were not connected to drug use. If you are having a party and someone brings drugs or utensils to the party then you can be charged with an offence even if you didn’t know the drugs were there. If you did not know the drugs or utensils were on your property it is up to you to prove that to the court. If you are sharing drugs you can be charged with a serious offence – supplying dangerous drugs. Noise There is no set time for when you have to stop making noise at a party but if someone nearby feels the noise is too loud they can call the police.

If the police think the noise is too loud they can come inside the house and direct you stop the noise immediately. If the noise continues after the police leave and the police come back they can take away the thing causing the noise e.g. portable speakers. Once police are in the house they can take action if anything illegal is happening, for example if they are there about noise but someone is using drugs they can charge them. Fights Touching someone or hitting them with something without their consent is an assault, for example pouring a can of soft drink over someone. If someone is seriously injured or killed you can be charged with a very serious offences, even if you think they wanted to fight you. If you are not actually in the fight but you are encouraging the fight you could be charged as well. The penalties for assaulting certain people are much higher, for example spitting on or biting police is up to 14 years imprisonment. You are entitled to defend yourself if you are attacked or to help someone else defend themselves, so long as you only use enough force to reasonably defend yourself or the other person. If you badly injure the other person it will be harder to show you used “reasonable” force. © Youth Advocacy Centre Inc Street Offences There are lots of laws about how people must behave in public including walking along the street or driving in a car.

As well as charging you police can move you on from public places and stop you coming back for up to 24 hours if you are you are making anyone feel anxious or disrupting the orderly conduct of an event, even if you aren’t doing anything. It is an offence to disobey a lawful direction given to you by police. The police must give you their name, rank and station when ordering you to move on. If you want to avoid drawing police attention to you in public you should remember these rules. Searches Police have powers which allow them to search you or your bags without a warrant, for example if they reasonably suspect you have drugs, a weapon or stolen property on you If police want to search you they have to “detain” you and tell you why. Before doing a search they should ask if you will agree. It is up to you whether you agree to the police doing a search, for example turning out your pockets for them, but if you do agree anything they find can be used as evidence in court. If you feel pressured into letting the police search then it is possible the court might say the search was unlawful. Asking you to take off outer clothing is not a strip search. Police cannot strip search you without a support person (parent or adult) being there unless it is an emergency.

Sex and sexting Having sex (including anal sex) under 16 is a serious offence. It doesn’t matter if you both want to have sex and you are both under 16. As well as sex it is also against the law to do sexual things to each other (like touching genitals). It is against the law for a parent, grandparent, brother or sister (including adopted or step siblings and foster siblings) to have sex with you. This is called UNDER REVIEW incest. There are also laws against taking and sharing indecent photos or videos of people under 16, even if they agree. This can include sending images of yourself. Child pornography is text, images or sound showing a person under 16 in a sexual way that is likely to offend an adult. It includes images of • the person’s breasts, bottom, penis or vagina; or • the person doing something sexual or near someone doing something sexual (such as having sex). Dealing with Police Police are not always in uniform. If a person in plain clothes says they are police ask for their ID. If a uniformed police officer is not wearing a name badge ask them their name and what station they are from. Stay cool and calm if the police approach you and treat them with respect.

State-school-suspensions.pdf,0,"State school suspensions When can I be suspended? The principal can ask you to stay away from school if you have been suspended or excluded.1 Suspension should only be used after other ways of addressing the problem have been tried e.g. a discipline improvement plan. Any student in any grade can be suspended.2 You can be suspended from a state school for:3 • disobedience (not doing what the teacher, staff member or principal asks you to do) • misbehaviour • conduct that the school thinks affects other students or is harmful to the proper running of the school (being disruptive in class, damaging school property or fighting in the playground) • being a risk to other students or staff • being charged by police with any offence. For some minor offences such as public nuisance you can only be suspended if the principal thinks it would not be in the best interests of other students or staff for you to be at school. It doesn’t matter whether the charge has anything to do with the school or if it happened outside of school hours or even that it did not happen in Queensland. You cannot be suspended from school for not complying with the school dress code, but you can be disciplined in another way such as not being allowed to engage in a certain school activity.4 How long can I be suspended for? You can be suspended from school by the principal for either 1 - 10 days or 10 – 20 days for serious grounds of suspensions.5 If you are suspended because you have been charged with an offence, then you are suspended until the court has decided your case.6 The principal can decide to lift the suspension, even though the court has not decided your case, if"

It is up to the principal to decide whether to suspend you and for how long: 1 - 10 days or 10 – 20 days.8 Generally - the more serious the alleged misbehaviour, the longer the suspension. The principal has to follow a process before they can suspend you, including giving you a chance to speak for yourself.9 When does the suspension start?

As soon as practical the principal has to give you a form which says you have been suspended.10 If you are suspended for 10 - 20 days or because you were charged with an offence the form must also tell you that you have the right to have the decision to suspend you reviewed (get the head of Education Queensland, the Chief Executive, to look at the matter).11 Do I have to do school work while I am suspended? If you are suspended, the principal must arrange for you to continue with your education during the suspension. This can mean doing anything that the principal thinks will help you improve your education. For example: • an alternate learning program: a list of programs can be found on the Education Queensland website • doing work at your school in an out of the way room supervised by a teacher’s aid, or • going to another school.12 Can I get the decision of the principal to suspend me for 1 - 10 days changed? The principal has the final say if you are being suspended for 1 – 10 days BUT you can make a complaint to Education Queensland about how the principal treated you or about how the decision was made if you think you it was unfair.13 You can also make an application to the Supreme Court for a Judicial Review but you should talk to a lawyer if you are considering this. 8 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 283. 9 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 283. 10 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 283. 11 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 283. 12"

Include all the important facts and anything else to support your case such as the names of people who will support what you say and any letters or emails. Also look at the procedures about suspension set out in the “School Discipline Procedure” document on Education Queensland’s website to see if the Principal has followed the rules. If not, you should include that information in the letter.

If you have been suspended you cannot enrol at another school unless the Chief Executive allows you to.16 How will I know about the Chief Executive’s decision? The Chief Executive has to tell you about his/her decision as soon as practical after they receive your letter - they may ring you and let you know the decision.17 You will then get the decision in writing which sets out the reasons for the decision.18 If you disagree with the decision you can make an application to the Supreme Court for Judicial Review but you should talk to a lawyer if you are considering this. 14 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 285. 15 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 286. 16 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 329. 17 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 286(2). 18 Education (General Provisions) Act 2006 (Qld) s 286(3).

The youth justice process The youth justice process can be divided into the following 3 parts. Open all 1. The police process Police are usually the first point of contact for a young offender. When a young person commits a crime, police could decide to: take no further action after completing their investigation issue a caution refer the young person to a restorative justice conferencing process.

A young person can stay in the community until the outcome of the court process has been finalised, or can be held in custody. Most offending by young people will be heard by a magistrate sitting in the Childrens Court. Townsville also has a Youth Court that makes sure all identified high risk and repeat young offenders (aged 10–17) appear in court before the same magistrate. Courts interpret and apply the laws made by Parliament. The Youth Justice Act 1992 (https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-1992-044) is the main piece of legislation that applies to young offenders (10–17 years). The magistrate works with the young person, their legal representatives and government departments to: hold them accountable keep the community safe work towards preventing the young person from reoffending. 3. The sentencing process If a young person pleads guilty to—or is found guilty of—offences when they go to court, they will be sentenced.

Children-Court-Queensland-Infosheet.pdf,0,"Childrens Court of Queensland What Courts do Young People under 18 go to? In Queensland if you are under 18 and the police charge you with an offence you will always go to a Childrens Court first. For some types of offences (called indictable offences) a defendant can choose a higher level court with a Judge to deal with it. Sometimes the Magistrate can decide the case must go to a higher court even if the young person does not choose this. If the indictable offence is a ‘serious’ offence under the Youth Justice Act or the person wants their case to go to the higher court to be decided, the Magistrate has to look at the police evidence to decide if the evidence is good enough for the case to go the higher court. After listening to the witnesses the Magistrate might decide there is not enough evidence and that is the end of the case. If a young person is found guilty or pleads guilty, a Magistrate will sometimes decide they cannot give the young person a serious enough sentence and they will send it to the higher court which has more power. The CCQ, District Court and Supreme Court in Brisbane are in the large courts complex in George Street in Brisbane, near the Roma Street train station. There are many Court Rooms and Judges in the complex. There are no duty lawyers in the CCQ, District or Supreme Courts. If you have to go to one of these courts it is important you see a lawyer beforehand. Childrens Court of Queensland (CCQ) If adult cases go to a higher court they go to either the District Court or if the matter is very serious, like murder or drug matters such as trafficking, to the Supreme Court."

Childrens Court of Queensland (CCQ) If adult cases go to a higher court they go to either the District Court or if the matter is very serious, like murder or drug matters such as trafficking, to the Supreme Court. If a young person’s case is sent to a higher court, it is usually sent to the Childrens Court of Queensland (CCQ) with a special Judge from the District Court. Matters involving young people can only be heard in the adult District Court or Supreme Court of Queensland if: • the child is charged after they turn 18 • the Magistrate has sent the case to the District Court because of special circumstances, for example, if a child is charged with committing the offence with an adult • the matter is very serious and has to be sent to the Supreme Court. If you plead not guilty in the CCQ you can choose to have a jury (a group of 12 people) listen to the witnesses and decide if you broke the law or you can choose to have the Judge do this. If you are in the District or Supreme Court and plead not guilty, then a jury has to decide whether you broke the law. If you plead or are found guilty in any of these courts, the Judge decides what sentence you get. This sheet is intended to provide general legal information about the law in Queensland.

The Judge will have an assistant who reads out the charge and there are also bailiffs who help the court, for example by passing around exhibits. No one is allowed to publish information identifying the person who is charged. District or Supreme Courts are open to the public so anyone can come in (eg groups of school students looking at how the courts work). What to do in Court? If you have to go to court, either because you have been charged with an offence or because you are a victim of crime or a witness, you should act respectfully. • Make sure your phone is turned off while you are in court • You should dress appropriately (no thongs or bare mid-riffs) • Remove your cap if you are wearing one • You should not laugh or giggle (even if you are nervous) • Answer questions respectfully – do not swear • Pay attention to what is being said • Look at the person when answering their questions • The Judge is called ‘Your Honour’ (always be respectful when speaking to them). If you treat the process seriously you will give yourself the best chance of being listened to. People in court need to focus on listening to what you are saying, not looking at what you are wearing.

If you disrespect the court you can be charged with another offence. How long will I have to be at court? Most courts start at 9am but you should check your paperwork and ask your lawyer about start times. If you do not have a lawyer you should get to court early (8.30am) so that you can find the court room and be ready when your name is called. If you are running late, call your lawyer or the court and let them know. Usually the court will have a lot of matters to get through on the one day so you may have to wait for your turn. Sometimes this can take a few hours so make sure you bring something suitable to do as well as something to eat. The bailiff will come outside the courtroom to the waiting area and call your name when it is your turn. If you are not there when your name is called (even if you were there at the start and later left) the Magistrate or Judge may order the police to find you and bring you to the court (issue a warrant for your arrest). If you have been charged with an offence you need to be in the courtroom the whole time your matter is being discussed with the Judge. If you are a witness you will be able to leave the court building once you have finished giving your evidence. Witnesses cannot be in the courtroom while other witnesses are giving their evidence. Courts normally break for lunch at 1pm for about an hour and sometimes will have a break for morning and/or afternoon tea."

If you have a particular legal problem you should contact a solicitor for legal advice. At the end is a list of agencies that might be able to assist you, including legal agencies. When can I start smoking cigarettes? There is no law that says when you can or can’t smoke cigarettes BUT it is against the law for an adult to sell or give you cigarettes if you are under 18. Shopkeepers can ask to see ID to prove you are 18. If someone like a police officer sees you being sold or given cigarettes and they ask for your name, age and address, you must tell them or you will be breaking the law. The police can take the cigarettes away for evidence against the person who sold/gave them to you and they do not have to give them back to you. Electronic Cigarettes are subject to the same laws as cigarettes. Electronic Cigarettes that contain nicotine are illegal in Queensland. When can I drink or buy alcohol? It is against the law for a person to sell someone under 18 alcohol. You can be asked to show ID to prove you are 18 or over before someone sells you alcohol. It is an offence to: • pretend to be 18 or over to try to get alcohol • fake an ID • change an ID Uto makeN you loDok 18 oEr over R REVIEW • give someone your ID to use.

If you are under 18 then a responsible adult can only supply you alcohol if you are on private premises AND you have a responsible adult supervising you. A responsible adult means your parent, step-parent, guardian or an adult who has parental rights and responsibility for you. The adult can be fined if they are not supervising you responsibly and the police can also confiscate (take and dispose of) the alcohol. To decide if you are being responsibly supervised the factors that can be considered are: • whether the adult or you are drinking or drunk • how old you are • whether you have eaten • the quantity of alcohol being consumed • whether the adult is with you and checking on how much you are drinking and what effect it is having on you • how much alcohol you are drinking over what period of time. Can I drink in a public place? If you are under 18 you are not allowed to drink alcohol in a public place. Generally no-one can drink in a public place unless there is a sign which says they can (for example, certain places at South Bank in Brisbane). However, people under 18 are not allowed to drink alcohol even in those areas unless they are with a responsible adult who is supervising the drinking. A public place includes cinemas, shopping centres, malls, buses, parks or the street. If you are under 18 you cannot carry alcohol in public. This includes carrying it for your friends or parents.

It is an offence to be drunk in a public place (no matter what your age). Using obscene or insulting language or behaving violently, disorderly or indecently is also an offence. These offences are called public nuisance offences. It is also an offence to be drunk or disorderly in a licensed place (such as a bar or a club). If you are acting drunk, creating a disturbance or enter without being allowed then the club may ask you to leave. They can use force that is reasonable and necessary if you fail to leave when asked. When can I be charged with a drug offence? You can be charged with a drug offence if you: • have possession of a dangerous drug (including marijuana, heroin, cocaine, LSD, ecstasy or speed) • have possession of property which police believe is to be used to commit a drug offence. This can include having a bong or a pipe on you, as well as scales or scissors. This does not apply to a syringe or needle if stored/disposed of properly.

If a police officer believes that you are using an inhalant or about to use an inhalant (chroming) then the police can take away whatever you are using to do this. It does not matter if it is not something illegal. For example if you have some glue. Although it is not an offence to have the glue, the police have the power to take the glue from you and you cannot get it back. The police officer can ask you if you have a reason for having the substance. If you do have a good reason (for example you have some glue because your parents asked you to buy it) then the police can allow you to keep it. The police will decide whether you can keep it. You should also remember not to mislead or lie to the police because you could be charged with obstructing police.

Victim-of-a-crime.pdf,0,"Victim of a crime Who is a victim? There are different types of victims of crimes. • Primary victims are those who are directly injured by the crime (for example you were assaulted while at a shopping centre) • Secondary victims are those who are injured because of witnessing a crime (for example developing anxiety after seeing an assault) • Parent secondary victims are parents who have been injured as a result from violence against their child (for example the parent becomes depressed) • A related victim is a close family member of a primary victim who has died, so they suffer an injury (for example the son of a father who is murdered suffers a trauma related injury). Can I get compensation? If you are a victim and have experienced harm, then you may be able to get a payment from the government.1 One way is through the Victims Assist Program.

But sometimes the police may want you to have a medical examination, to gather evidence for the case. This is your decision. If you say no, the police may not be able to take the offender to court because there may not be enough evidence. A court can order a medical examination if Child Safety is assessing whether you are at risk of further harm and a Child Protection Order should be taken out. You should get your own legal advice if this is happening to you. What happens if I change my mind? If you change your mind about going to court you can ask the police for a ‘Withdrawal of Complaint’ form. This form should be completed as soon as possible. It is a police decision whether to drop your case. This may depend on a few things such as whether they have completed their investigations into your case and have found enough evidence to continue to court. The police will not necessarily drop the case because you no longer want to go to court. If you change your mind it is a good idea to contact one of the agencies under ‘Who can help?’ to support you in telling the police your decision. What about court?

If the case is not taken to court, it is because the police do not have enough evidence. This does not necessarily mean that the police do not believe you. Will I have to be a witness at court? If you are the victim and the alleged offender (defendant) says they are not guilty, it is very likely that you will have to give evidence to a court. If you are under 16 your statement will be recorded on video. This will be used as your evidence at the committal (the initial court proceedings). It will also be used as your evidence at the trial. The lawyer for the defendant can still ask you questions at a pre-trial hearing (the pre-recording), however there are rules about the type of questions that they can ask. It is also possible to give evidence through an audio-visual link and not actually be in the court room. If this option is not available then you are entitled to give evidence from behind a screen so you do not have to see the defendant. Being a witness can be difficult because you have to say what happened to you and answer questions from the alleged offender's lawyer.

Police-Facts-You-Need-to-Know-November-2023 (1).pdf,0,"POLICE – FACTS YOU NEED TO KNOW This sheet is intended to provide general legal information about the law in Queensland. This information is not legal advice. If you have a particular legal problem you should contact a solicitor for legal advice. At the end is a list of agencies that might be able to assist you, including legal agencies. What do I have to tell the police? You have the right to silence. This applies even if you have been arrested for questioning. This means that do not have to make a statement or answer any questions, except you must give your correct name, address, and age. Not giving your name, address or age is an offence. Remember, there is no such thing as an ‘off-the-record chat.’ If you choose to answer police questions you can choose to answer only some of the questions and not all. It is a good idea to get legal advice before answering police questions. You can get free legal advice from the lawyers listed below. Anything you say can be used (and often is) in a police case against you. Do I have to carry ID on me? No… There is no law that says you have to carry ID, BUT if a police officer believes you have given a false name, address or age, they can detain you to find out who you are. If you are driving a car (including on a ‘L’ or ‘P’ plate) then it is an offence to fail to produce your driver’s licence if the police request it. Do Police have to show their ID?

Sometimes… If a police officer is in plain clothes and they want to do something like arrest, search or make you ‘move-on’ the officer must tell you that they are a police officer and state their name, rank and station and show you their ID. If they are in uniform, they just have to tell you their name, rank and station. If the officer does not tell you, you can ASK. Do I have to go with a police officer? You do not have to go with a police officer unless you are arrested, but there is a law which states you must go with them if you have witnessed a breach of the peace. The police can arrest you to question you if they believe that you have broken or are breaking the law. If you are arrested for questioning you still do not have to answer any questions except to give your correct name, address and age. Unless the police know a lawyer has been organised for you, the police must contact a representative from a legal aid organisation and inform them before you are questioned. When can the police take my photograph? The police can only photograph you if you are arrested and charged. You do not have to agree to be photographed when being ‘street checked”. All police have body-worn cameras and there are rules police have to follow about how they use these cameras. All police must wear a body-worn camera while they are on-duty, and they can record you.

What rules do the police have to follow when using a body-worn camera? • The police cannot record unclothed searches, but can record clothed searches • The police do not have to stop recording you if you ask • The police generally have to be in uniform, or easily identifiable as a police officer, when using a body-worm camera • Whatever the police record can be used as evidence. If police have Body Worn Cameras they must record if they - • Are investigating a crime (e.g. seizing property or searching you) or arresting someone • Are using physical force against a person • Believe something should be recorded (the police can also start recording after an incident occurs). Do I have to be in a line up or give a DNA sample? No… You do not have to go with a police officer to be in a line up or to give them your DNA even if the police say they think you have broken the law. You should talk to a lawyer before agreeing to either of these things. © Youth Advocacy Centre Inc 1 Can police move me on?

You can ask why you are under arrest, but resisting arrest is an offence. You have the right to ask why the police officer is demanding you go with them. If you are not under arrest, then you do not have to go with the police. If you are under arrest, a police officer must tell you why you are under arrest. Even if you have been arrested and charged you do not have to answer police questions. The police usually will not tell you about your right to remain silent unless they have decided to charge you with a criminal offence. A police officer is only allowed to use ‘reasonable force’ to carry out their job. Stay cool and calm and talk to a lawyer later about what you can do if you think the arrest was unfair or wrong or the police injured you. How long can the police hold me? The police can arrest and hold you for questioning for up to 8 hours to investigate an offence and question you about any offences they think you may have committed. They can only question you for 4 hours of that time. The time limit starts at the time you were arrested or were taken by police. The police can ask a JP or Magistrate to allow them to hold you and question you for a longer period of time. Remember, you can be held for questioning but you do not have to answer any questions, except your name, age and address. Who can I have with me during police questioning?

Who can I have with me during police questioning? Generally, if you are under 18 and questioned by police, you must have a ‘support person’ with you. The support person should be: • a parent or guardian • a lawyer • a person who is acting for you who works in an agency that deals with the law • a relative or friend you would like to have there. • If none of these are available, then a justice of the peace (JP). You should tell the police which person you would like to have with you. The police should also give you the opportunity to talk to this person in private (where they cannot overhear you) before the questioning starts. If you are arrested the police have to make a reasonable effort to contact your parents, the police must take note if they cannot contact your parents. If you are being questioned about a minor offence such as littering then a ‘support person’ is not required. How much do I have to tell police at the station? You still have the right to silence at the police station.

If you do participate in a police interview about a serious criminal offence, then the police should record it on video or audio. The police will give you a copy of the DVD after the interview. It is important to keep this DVD. If the police are unable to record your interview, then they can write it down and read it back to you. If you don’t agree with anything in the statement you should tell them at the time and ask them to change it. The police must give you a copy of the written record at the time. Even if you answered the questions you do not have to sign what the police wrote down. Do not sign anything you have not read, do not understand, or do not agree with.

At the end is a list of agencies that might be able to assist you, but please note that the Youth Advocacy Centre does not take direct enquiries from parents. Parents will commonly first learn that their child may have broken the law when the police phone or arrive at the door. It is important to: • keep calm • find out as much as possible about what the police say the young person has done – remember a complaint to police does not automatically mean your child has broken the law (even if they have done something wrong) • ask why the police want to speak with your child. It is recommended your child tells police that they will decide whether to give a statement or answer questions after they have spoken with a lawyer. Your child may call the Youth Hotline on 1800 527 527 or if your child identifies as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander, they may call ATSILS on 1800 012 255. For information on what your child does or does not have to do in relation to police, and what happens if they have to go to court, see the YAC Info sheets: Police – Facts You Need to Know; If I am Charged; Court; Childrens Court Queensland; Court Orders.

The rest of this sheet is info for you as a parent. Are police allowed to come into my home or search my car? There are a number of ways the police can legally conduct a search. The three main ways are: • Search warrant - if police seek to enter your home or examine your car with a search warrant you UNDER REVIEW have the right to get a copy of this warrant and the name, rank and station of the police officer. • Reasonable suspicion - police can enter a private place, such as your home or car, without a warrant, if they have ‘reasonable suspicion’ that they will find evidence of an offence and this evidence may be hidden or destroyed unless the place is immediately searched. • Consent - if you give police permission to search, then the police can stay in your home or keep searching your car until such time as you withdraw that consent and then they have to leave unless they have a specific power they are relying on to stay and search. If police take away any property belonging to you or your child the police must provide a field property receipt. As a parent, do I have to call the police if I think my child may have broken the law? If you are concerned your child may have broken the law you do not have to contact the police: however, there are potential consequences for parents if their child brings some things into the home.

For example, if you think your child is using drugs then you are not under a legal obligation to let police know. However, if police find drugs belonging to your child at your home, it is assumed you had knowledge of the drugs since you are deemed to have control of the house. You may have to prove you did not know the drugs were there and that you had no reason to suspect the drugs were there. If you try to hide evidence of an offence or do something like putting items you think have been stolen in the bin, you could also be charged with breaking the law. This means you do not have to tell police about anything your child may have done, but you also cannot do anything to cover up what they may have done. If your child is over 18 and you have a reasonable suspicion that they have committed a sexual offence against a child, you are required to report this to police. As a parent do I have to go with police or give a statement to police? During an investigation police may seek to gather information from many sources including parents, even if the parents are not directly involved. There is, however, no legal obligation for a person to talk to police about any matter. You do not have to go anywhere with police, such as to the police station, unless you are under arrest.

The police might want to question you about where your child was at a certain time. If the police approach you to give a statement it is important to know that you do not have to say anything, but you should never lie to police, or try to mislead police as this may lead to you being charged (e.g. you should not say your child was at home at a certain time when you know they were not). © Youth Advocacy Centre Inc 1 If the police approach you or your child it is best to give your correct name, address, and age as it can be an offence not to do this. Be aware that anything you say (even on the street) may be tape-recorded without you knowing. There is no such thing as an ‘informal’ or ‘off the record’ chat or interview What is a support person’s role in a police recorded interview? A person under 18 years of age must have a support person at a police interview. This support person has to make sure the child understands the process and their rights, that they can exercise those rights, and to ensure that the police conduct the interview fairly. If your child decides to agree to an interview, one of the best ways to support them is to organise for the interview to take place after your child has spoken with a lawyer. Unless the police know a lawyer has been organised for your child, the police must contact a representative from a legal aid organisation and inform them before they question your child.

See the list below for phone numbers for free legal help. If you are angry with your child, then your ability to be a support person can be a problem. Before the interview you should confirm that your child wants you to be their support person or if they might want another trusted objective adult to support them. What is a parent’s role if the young person formally admits that they broke the law and the police: • Caution the young person (give them a formal warning) because they have not been in much trouble before or have not committed a serious offence. The police must ensure either an adult chosen by the child or a parent is present for the Caution. There is no obligation on a parent to be present but if you do not attend and there is no other adult the child wants there then the police will not be able to issue the Caution which may mean they charge the young person instead and your child will have to go to court. • let the young person attend a Restorative Justice Conference where they will have the opportunity to discuss the consequences of committing the offence with the people they affected, such as the victim. The aim of the conference is that both parties agree on how the young person will make amends such as: an apology; agreeing to pay the victim some money or agreeing to attend a program. The young person must have a support person at the conference. Parents are entitled to be there"

The young person must have a support person at the conference. Parents are entitled to be there even if the young person is supported by another adUult. NDER REVIEW • offer a Drug Diversion Assessment Program if drugs were involved and the police believe a Caution is not suitable. The Drug Diversion Assessment Program is one session with a drug counsellor that lasts around two hours. Parents do not need to attend the program. If the young person is charged and has to go to court - do I have to be there as a parent? If a young person has to go to court, the court usually requires the parent to be there. If no parent attends, the court will want to know where the parents are and why they are not present. The court can issue a notice ordering the parents to come to court, and if they still do not attend the parents can be fined by the court. When the Magistrate/Judge chooses the most appropriate court order (sentence) for the young person, they will consider how the young person’s parent has responded to the alleged offence. Helping your child to learn from the event and to change their behaviour will be viewed positively by the courts. What if my child is the victim of a crime?

If you have a reasonable suspicion that a sexual offence has occurred against a child by an adult, then you are required to report this to police. It is important to understand what may happen if a matter is reported to police. It may be useful to talk to a lawyer first. If young people decide to report crime to police, the police decide if they are going to charge someone. Your child may be eligible for victim’s compensation and should speak to a lawyer about this. YAC can provide support to young people appearing as complainants or witnesses in court matters and help them to manage the process. See contact details below. How can I withdraw a complaint to police about my child? Sometimes parents complain to or call the police about their child and the police then charge the young person with an offence – such as with wilful damage or assault. Parents should be aware of the legal and non-legal consequences of this and should get some advice before speaking with the police. If a parent later decides that they don’t want the matter to go to court, they can seek to withdraw their complaint at any time, including after the young person has been charged and court proceedings have started. Any officer at a police station counter can assist the parent in filling out a ‘Withdrawal of Complaint’ form.

Legal-Info-Sheet-Making-Queensland-Safer-Bill-2024-1.pdf,0,"What do the new “adult crime, adult time” laws say? Queensland has new laws about youth crime. If you commit an offence while you are under 18 this is what the changes may mean for you. What is “adult crime, adult time”? There are now 13 offences for which children can receive the same penalty as an adult. The offence must have been committed after the 12th December 2024 for this to apply. The 13 offences are: • Unlawful use of a motor vehicle • Unlawful entry of a vehicle • Dangerous operations of a motor vehicle • Break and enter premises • Burglary • Robbery • Serious assault • Wounding • Acts intended to cause grievous bodily harm • Grievous bodily harm • Unlawful striking causing death • Manslaughter • Murder For these offences a magistrate may now sentence you to up to three years probation or detention. A judge can give you the same maximum penalty that an adult can get. A court can no longer order a restorative justice order for these offences. The court can still send you to another type of restorative justice process, like a pre-sentence (before sentence) referral. A mandatory sentence is a sentence that the court must give. If these apply to adults for the 13 offences they now apply to you as a child. This sheet is intended to provide general legal information about the law in Queensland.

What if I've committed an offence on or before the 12th December 2024? The “adult crime, adult time” laws won’t apply: you will be sentenced as the law was before these changes. If you are over 18, the laws about you being held in or moved to an adult prison will apply even if your offence took place on or before the 12th December 2024. How has sentencing changed? If you are found guilty for any offence committed as a child after the 12th of December then the matters to be considered to determine your penalty has changed. The new law says the court cannot consider that detention should be a last resort and that it would be preferable for you to stay in the community.1 The new law now requires a court to primarily consider the impact of the offence on any victim when sentencing you. What does the impact to a victim mean? The impact to a victim could mean how the offending affected the victim’s mental health, physical and emotional wellbeing, financial wellbeing, the cost of repairs, the time taken off work, the impact of not having a car and their feelings of safety. What criminal history is considered when I go to court? There are changes about when your criminal history can be given to an adult court and what can be included on your criminal history including cautions and restorative justice processes.

These changes have not started yet. I am in a youth detention centre and will turn 18 before I am released. When will I need to be moved to an adult prison? Under the new laws, if you are in detention and you turn 18 you will usually be transferred to an adult prison. This will occur within 30 days of your 18th birthday. In limited circumstances, Youth Justice may allow you to stay in the detention centre if they think you are not a threat to the centre or people in it. If you are transferred to an adult prison and you are on a sentence, you will be released on parole on the day you would have been released from detention. If you are on remand and you are sentenced to a period of detention you will serve the sentence in an adult prison. If you believe you will turn 18 while in detention you should talk to your lawyer and case worker.

Examples of discrimination are: • paying workers from a different cultural heritage less money than white workers • excluding a young woman from school because she is pregnant • refusing to rent a flat to someone who is from a different country • refusing to let a gay child join their local sports team • inappropriate sexual comments in the workplace. What is sexual harassment? This is another form of discrimination. This means that you are being intimidated, offended and/or humiliated in a sexual way. It can include someone suggesting or trying to get you to have sex, trying to touch you in a way you don't like, or displaying photographs that upset or offend you. Sexual harassment is against the law in Queensland.3 What can I do? Some laws on discrimination apply all over Australia. These are dealt with by the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC). Other laws apply only in Queensland and complaints go to the Queensland Human Rights Commission (QHRC). Not all discrimination is against the law. You will need to check with AHRC and QHRC to see what you can do in your situation. You can call the AHRC on 1300 369 711 and the QHRC on 1300 130 670. If you feel you are being treated unfairly or differently to others, you can talk to the person who is being unfair. Sometimes telling them how you feel may be enough to make them stop. You could ask someone else to go with you when you talk to the person.

It involves making a person fear that some violence may be done to them, their property or someone close to them. Things that might make them scared include: • being followed or watched • telephone calls which are threatening or keep happening even when the person has been asked not to call • interfering with their property • leaving stuff around which they would find offensive. It does not matter if the victim was afraid or suffered any harm. It only matters that the behaviour would typically cause people to feel afraid or suffer harm.4 Stalking is a crime.5 If you think this is happening to you, you should keep a record of what's going on with dates and times.

Arriving at a youth detention centre Each young person must undertake a health assessment when they arrive at the youth detention centre. This includes assessing risk of self-harm or suicide. The young person will be asked if they have any existing mental health concerns and if they are on medication. Queensland Health will help the young person to get support and medication while they are in detention. https://www.youthjustice.qld.gov.au/parents-carers/youth-detention/helping-young-people-in-detention/health-and-wellbeing 2/5 26/08/2025, 15:36 Health and wellbeing | Department of Youth Justice and Victim Support Self-harm and suicide risk Youth detention staff regularly discuss and update each young person’s suicide prevention plan. The updates are based on: current risks current needs their protective factors (things in their life that help connect and support them) how they are engaging in therapeutic interventions. If we assess a young person as having suicide risk, our staff will make scheduled checks on them and document this along with any changes in their behaviour. We will review the young person each day to see if those observations need to increase or decrease and if they need extra support. Our caseworkers and psychologists provide intensive support to reduce the young person’s risks over time.

Going-to-Court.pdf,0,"Going to court Which Court? If you are under 18 and the police believe you have broken the law and decide to take you to court, you will first go to a Childrens Court where there is a Magistrate.1 The paperwork the police give you will let you know where the court is. Later, you may have your case sent to a Childrens Court Judge.2 If you are charged with the most serious offences like murder, or drug matters like trafficking, then your case will have to be sent to the Supreme Court. What happens if I don't turn up to court? The court can issue a warrant for your arrest (this is an order that the police find you and bring you to the court).3 If your case cannot be dealt with on the day that the police find you, you will probably be kept in custody (locked up) until the court can deal with your case. You may also be charged with ‘failing to appear’ (not going to court when told to).4 The court will then have a record that you did not turn up and this may make it harder for you to get bail (be able to live in the community while your case is being dealt with) in the future. What are my choices when I get to court? There should be a duty lawyer at court to help you with your case and you should ask to see them before going into court. The duty lawyer is free. You can: • plead guilty (agree you did what the police say) • plead not guilty (you do not agree with the police or you want them to prove you did it) • have your case brought back to court on another day so you can"

If there is no duty lawyer you can ask the court to adjourn your case (set another date or time to deal with your case) so that a lawyer can be at court with you.

This may also happen if the police have not got their case ready. If you were kept in custody until coming to court you will need the help of the duty lawyer to try to get bail. The duty lawyer should tell you about legal aid (free legal help from a solicitor who can also go to court with you) and give you a form to apply for legal aid. Ask for a form if the duty lawyer doesn't give you one. Am I allowed to have an interpreter with me in court? Yes. If English is not the language you best understand, the court may allow an interpreter, or another person you choose to be in court to interpret for you. If there is no interpreter available at court, you can ask the court to arrange this for you. Do my parents have to be in court? Yes. If your parents are not there the court can decide to adjourn your case (set another date or time to deal with your case) so that the court can be sure a parent knows about your case and that they can be there. The Court can also order your parents to be there, and if they do not go, they can be fined. If your parent, guardian or foster parent was not at court when your case was heard they can ask the court that your case be heard again with them there.6 Who else will be in court?

Childrens (Magistrates) Courts where young people under 18 appear on criminal matters are closed to members of the public.7 Some people will always be allowed to be in court. They are: • the police prosecutor • your lawyer • a representative of Youth Justice (a government department) • a parent or member of your family • a person giving evidence in court (a witness) • a person from an organisation supporting you if you are Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander (for example a Community Justice Group) • someone who can help the Magistrate in dealing with the specific matter or who the Magistrate thinks has a proper reason to be there (such as someone in court doing approved research) • the victim of the crime or their representative • a relative of a deceased victim and their representative • a person who the court believes has a proper interest in the proceed • an accredited media entity, for example a reporter The media will not be able to report details about your identity when you are appearing on any criminal matter.

Can I be charged as an adult with a crime I committed when I was a child? When you turn 18 you generally must go to an adult court. If you are 19 or over, and the police say you broke the law when you were under 18, it is most likely that you will be dealt with as an adult.10 If you are not yet 19 and the police say you broke the law when you were under 18, then your case will generally go to a Childrens Court. If you agree you broke the law, or the court decides that you did, then you will be sentenced as if you were under 18.11 If you are over 18 years and sentenced to detention you serve your term in an adult prison. Can police take my photograph and fingerprints? If you are arrested by police and then taken to the police station and charged the police can usually photograph you (including photos of scars and tattoos) and take your fingerprints and other identifying particulars (things specific to you that could prove who you are).12 For some offences,13 if the police have charged you but did not arrest you on the spot the police might ask the Childrens Court magistrate to let them take those photos, fingerprints or other identifying particulars (such as your footprints or recording of your voice or a measurement of any part of your body - but not genital or anal area, buttocks or, for"

You or your lawyer can go to court to say why the police should not be able to get these details.15 If you or your lawyer don’t go to court when the police are asking for the order the court can still give the police permission to get the particulars.16 The court will only make this order if the police can show that they already have some evidence (eg fingerprints) that shows an offence has been committed and they have reason to think you have committed the offence.17 The order will help the police do their investigation by letting them compare your particulars to the evidence they already have.

Government-Security-Officers-Updated-June-2023WM1.pdf,0,"GOVERNMENT SECURITY OFFICERS This sheet is intended to provide general legal information about the law in Queensland. This information is not legal advice. If you have a particular legal problem you should contact a solicitor for legal advice. At the end is a list of agencies that might be able to assist you, including legal agencies. Government security officers are protective security officers, who are not police officers, are hired by the government to monitor state buildings and facilities. The main purpose of security officers is to act as security guards to state buildings. At times they may also work as guards for buildings which are not state buildings. If they are NOT working at a STATE building, they are not considered “government security officers” and only have the powers of a regular security guard – see the security guard fact sheet. What are the powers of protective security officers? If you are inside or within the precinct of a state building, a protective security officer may ask:-  Your name and address  Evidence of your name or address (driver’s licence, student ID card etc)  Your reason for being at the building. If you provide the officer with false information, do not provide any information, do not provide any evidence of your name or address, or provide the officer with a fake ID, or an ID card that contains someone else’s details – then you will have committed an offence. If the building that you are entering has electronic screening devices such as a metal detector, an x- ray machine or hand held scanner, the officer can ask you to:  walk through the metal detector  pass your things through an X-ray machine  allow the officer to scan you and/or your belongings with a hand held"

UNDER REVIEW What is a state building?  A state building is any building that is owned by the government (State libraries, public service buildings, council offices).  This also includes any outside part of the building like a courtyard, garden, park. Powers of a protective security officer If an officer considers it necessary for the security of a state building, they can ask you to:  let them look through your things,  take off outer garments for inspection (jackets, jumpers etc),  empty all of your pockets,  open your things for inspection,  open a vehicle or part of it for inspection,  take something off the vehicle for inspection, and  park the vehicle in a specified place. If an officer believes you are using one of your belongings to hide something dangerous or an unlawful item (weapon or drugs) then they can ask you to put the item in a certain place. If you are in possession of an unlawful item, they may seize it. Other powers  If you fail to provide them with your name and address, or are acting in a way which makes them think you are not there for a “good and lawful” purpose they can ask you to leave the building.  If you do not leave when asked, the officer and other officers can use necessary force to remove you from the building.  You can be fined up to $2,200.00 if you provide false details like"

Otherwise, they must get another officer or adult assisting the officer of the same sex to search you or your clothing.  If the officer wants you to take off an outer garment, they must tell you the reason for the request and ask you to do this in a room out of the public view.  They need to inspect you in a way that does not embarrass you and ensure the protection of you dignity.  Provided your things are not unlawful to possess, a security officer must give back your things when you ask for them and it is clear that you are actually going to leave the building.  If you tell an officer before or during a search of you or your things that you do not want to be searched and are going to leave the building, you will need to leave and the officer must not give you a direction to enter or leave the building or take your belongings.  BEFORE a security officer asks you to provide your name and address or leave a government building they need to warn"

Can protective security officers arrest me? If the protective security officer thinks that you have committed an offence then they can, with the help of other protective security officers, use necessary force to detain you. However, they must quickly hand you over to police. Try to remain calm and not fight back because assaulting or resisting a security officer is an offence – with a maximum penalty of 6 months imprisonment.
